Abstract

Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) is a promising intervention to enhance global cognitive function. However, it remains unclear if digital CRT (DCRT) is as effective as conventraditional CRT. The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of conventraditional CRT and DCRT on global cognitive function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.

Both conventtraditional CRT (SMD = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.23–0.88) and DCRT (SMD = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.23–0.71) significantly improved MMSE scores. Network meta-analysis revealed no significant difference between CRT and DCRT (SMD = –0.08, p = 0.671), with low heterogeneity and no evidence of publication bias.

Pairwise and network meta-analyses of 17 trials were conducted assessed the efficacy of CRT and DCRT. Changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of pre- and post-interventions for both CRT and DCRT groups were analysed.
