N2  - Aims: The nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) is a major source of cholinergic innervation in the central nervous system. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of structural and functional alterations in the NBM and its projections in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the effects of computerized cognitive training (CCT). <ovid:br/>Method(s): Forty-five patients with MCI and 45 cognitively unimpaired controls (CUCs) were recruited. NBM volume, mean diffusivity (MD) of NBM white matter (WM) projections, and functional connectivity (FC) of projections of the NBM were measured with T1-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Thirty-six MCI patients were randomly assigned to receive CCT or control training. The effects of CCT on the neuropsychological measures and MRI properties were analyzed with a linear mixed model (LMM). <ovid:br/>Result(s): We detected that compared with the CUCs, the MCI patients had a reduced volume of the NBM and a greater MD of both cholinergic pathways. Increased MD values of both pathways were related to lower scores of global cognition, processing speed and attention in all participants. After CCT intervention, significant group x timepoint effects on score of the Backward Digit Span and the FC between NBM and right putamen were observed in the CCT group compared to the control group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): NBM atrophy and WM pathway disruption occurred in MCI patients and were correlated with cognitive impairment. Working memory and the FC between NBM and right putamen could be improved by cognitive training.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - (1) Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 70% of dementia cases and with no effective pharmacological treatments, new rehabilitation methods are needed. Motor and cognitive activities and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have shown promise in stabilizing and enhancing cognitive functions. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): we want to investigate the effects of tDCS combined with motor or cognitive activity on cognitive functions in AD patients. (2) Methods: Patients with mild or moderate AD were randomized between anodic tDCS groups (MotA or CogA) and sham tDCS groups (MotS or CogS). They received two weeks of treatment (45 min, five days/week), with the first 15 min using tDCS stimulation on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Cognitive assessments were conducted pre-treatment (T0), post-treatment (T1), and one week after (T2). (3) Results: Twenty-three patients were included. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between anodic tDCS groups (MotA + CogA) and sham tDCS groups (MotS + CogS) with advantages for the first in improving global cognitive status (p = 0.042), selective attention (p = 0.012), and sustained attention (p = 0.012). Further analysis indicated no differences between the two anodic tDCS groups between T0 and T1. (4) <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): combined anodal tDCS with motor or cognitive activity could improve global cognitive state and attention, slowing cognitive decline in AD patients. The trial was registered on Clinical Trials: NCT06619795.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 by the authors.

N2  - PURPOSE: To examine the factor structure and predictive utility of four instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) measures to identify cognitive status changes among older adults enrolled in the ACTIVE Trial. MAJOR FINDINGS: Extracted factors represented IADL instruments. Baseline performance on the Everyday Problems Test (EPT) predicted 5-year MMSE scores (est. = .08, p < .001), adjusting for demographic and health covariates, baseline MMSE, self-reported IADL function, and the performance-based Observed Tasks of Daily Living and Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living assessments. For each 1-point increase in baseline EPT financial performance, the odds of cognitive impairment decreased by 26%. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): IADL functional domains were not interchangeable across instruments. The EPT demonstrated better predictive utility compared to other instruments for detecting subsequent cognitive decline/impairment. This is a useful step in developing effective tools to detect early functional deficits indicating subsequent clinical impairment.

N2  - Combined exercise and cognitive training have been evidenced to be effective in cognitive and physical functions in post-stroke survivors. Recent interest has gradually shifted to technology-aided cognitive rehabilitation. However, clear neural makers or comprehensive behavioral indexes used for evaluating rehabilitation remain unexplored. The study aimed to examine the effects of two types of combined exercise-cognitive training on stroke patients with cognitive dysfunction, focusing on neural and behavioral markers. 39 patients were randomly assigned to sequential exercise-cognitive training, simultaneous exercise-cognitive training or active control groups and underwent 60 minutes/day training, 3 days/week, for 12 weeks. 29 patients ultimately completed the training. The markers/indexes included cognitive function, physical function, instrumental activities of daily living, and caregiver strain. Cognitive function included working memory task performance, neurophysiological markers, and cognitive indexes. The results indicated no d-prime difference between groups after the training. The simultaneous training demonstrated significant improvements in the neurophysiological marker of P300 and theta coherence compared to the other groups. Moreover, the simultaneous training also led to significant enhancements in physical function, as measured by the Rivermead Mobility Index, comparing to the other groups. Further analysis contrasting the two exercise-cognitive trainings revealed that improvements in cognition and multifaceted domains (i.e., instrumental activities of daily living and caregiver strain) were manifested in the simultaneous training. Together with the neural markers identified in the current interventions, the differential impacts of the two interventions indicates the potential of technology-driven and personalized rehabilitation in post-stroke patients.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2001-2011 IEEE.

N2  - Cognitive training (CT) programs aim to improve cognitive performance and impede its decline. Thus, defining the characteristics of individuals who can benefit from these interventions is essential. Our objectives were to assess if the cognitive reserve (CR), APOE genotype (e4 carriers/non-carriers) and/or hippocampal volume might predict the effectiveness of a CT program. Participants were older adults without dementia (n = 226), randomized into parallel experimental and control groups. The assessment consisted of a neuropsychological protocol and additional data regarding total intracranial, gray matter, left/right hippocampus volume; APOE genotype; and Cognitive Reserve (CR). The intervention involved multifactorial CT (30 sessions, 90 min each), with an evaluation pre- and post-training (at six months); the control group simply following the center's routine activities. The primary outcome measures were the change in cognitive performance and the predictors of change. The results show that APOE-e4 non-carriers (79.1%) with a larger left hippocampal volume achieved better gains in semantic verbal fluency (R<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> =.19). Subjects with a larger CR and a greater gray matter volume better improved their processing speed (R<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> =.18). Age was correlated with the improvement in executive functions, such that older age predicts less improvement (R<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> =.07). Subjects with a larger left hippocampal volume achieved more significant gains in general cognitive performance (R<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> =.087). In conclusion, besides the program itself, the effectiveness of CT depends on age, biological factors like genotype and brain volume, and CR. Thus, to achieve better results through a CT, it is essential to consider the different characteristics of the participants, including genetic factors.

N2  - Background/Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the acute effects of a single session of a VR exergame (Beat Saber) and a VR nature video (Ireland 4K) on attentional performance, using the Flanker and Attentional Blink (AB) tasks. The objective was to assess whether these VR interventions could enhance attentional control, as measured by improvements in response times and accuracy. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A total of 39 psychology students, aged 19-25, were randomly assigned to one of three groups: VR exergame, VR nature video, or control. Participants completed the Flanker and AB tasks before and after the intervention. A repeated measures design was employed to analyze changes in response times and accuracy across pre- and post-test sessions. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The study revealed significant improvements in response times and accuracy across all groups in the post-test measures, indicating a strong training effect. In the AB task, shorter stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) led to decreased accuracy and slower response times, emphasizing the difficulty in processing closely spaced targets. The interaction between Type and Group in response times for target stimuli suggested that the intervention types differentially influenced processing speed in specific conditions. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The findings suggest that while brief VR interventions did not produce significant differences between groups, the training effect observed highlights the influence of task-specific factors such as SOA and target presence. Further research is needed to explore whether longer or repeated VR sessions, as well as the optimization of task-specific parameters, might lead to more pronounced cognitive benefits.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 by the authors.

N2  - Background: The process of aging often accompanies a decline in cognitive function, postural control, and gait stability, consequently increasing the susceptibility to falls among older individuals. In response to these challenges, motor-cognitive training has emerged as a potential intervention to mitigate age-related declines. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study aims to assess the acute effects of two distinct motor-cognitive training modalities, treadmill dual-task training (TMDT) and interactive motor-cognitive training (IMCT), on cognitive function, postural control, walking ability, and dual-task performance in the elderly population. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In this randomized crossover study, 35 healthy elderly individuals (aged 60-75) participated in three acute training sessions involving TMDT, IMCT, and a control reading condition. Assessments of executive function, postural control, gait performance, and cognitive accuracy were conducted both before and after each session. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Both TMDT and IMCT improved executive functions. Notably, IMCT resulted in a significant enhancement in correct response rates and a reduction in reaction times in the Stroop task (p < 0.05) compared to TMDT and the control condition. IMCT also led to an increase in dual-task gait speed (p < 0.001) and showed a trend towards improved cognitive accuracy (p = 0.07). Conversely, TMDT increased postural sway with eyes open (p = 0.013), indicating a potential detriment to postural control. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The findings suggest that IMCT holds greater immediate efficacy in enhancing cognitive function and gait stability among older adults compared to TMDT, with a lesser adverse impact on postural control. This underscores the potential of IMCT as a preferred approach for mitigating fall risk and enhancing both cognitive and physical functions in the elderly population.<ovid:br/>Copyright 2024 Li et al.

N2  - Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multi-domain cognitive training (CT) may slow cognitive decline and delay AD onset. However, most work involves short interventions, targeting single cognitive domains or lacking active controls. We conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of a 6-month, multi-domain CT on Fluid Cognition, functional connectivity in memory and executive functioning networks (primary outcomes), and white matter microstructural properties (secondary outcome) in aMCI. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to either a multi-domain CT or crossword training (CW) group, and thirty-four participants completed the intervention. We found a significant group-by-time interaction in Fluid Cognition (p = 0.007, F (1,28) = 8.26, Cohen's d = 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.45-14.4), with 90% of CT patients showing post-intervention improvements (p < 0.01, Cohen'sd = 0.7). The CT group also showed better post-intervention Fluid Cognition than healthy controls (HCs, N = 45, p = 0.045). Functional connectivity analyses showed a significant group-by-time interaction (Cohen's d >= 0.8) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior parietal cortex (IPC) networks. Specifically, CT displayed post-intervention increases whereas CW displayed decreases in functional connectivity. Moreover, increased connectivity strength between the left DLPFC and medial PFC was associated with improved Fluid Cognition. At a microstructural level, we observed a decline in fiber density (FD) for both groups, but the CT group declined less steeply (1.3 vs. 2%). The slower decline in FD for the CT group in several tracts, including the cingulum-hippocampus tract, was associated with better working memory. Finally, we identified regions in cognitive control and memory networks for which baseline functional connectivity and microstructural properties were associated with changes in Fluid Cognition. Long-term, multi-domain CT improves cognitive functioning and functional connectivity and delays structural brain decline in aMCI (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT03883308).<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The number of people with dementia is increasing in Japan, and establishing evidence for preventing dementia is necessary. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): This study was a randomized controlled trial in cognitively normal community-dwelling older adults aged 65 to 85 with diabetes and/or hypertension. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group underwent 90 min of group-based weekly physical exercise, cognitive training, nutritional counseling, and vascular risk management for 18 months. The primary endpoint was the change in a cognitive composite score calculated by averaging the z-scores of seven neuropsychological tests from baseline to 18 months. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): We randomly assigned 203 participants to two groups, and 178 (87.7%) completed the 18-month follow-up. There was a significant group difference in the cognitive composite score change at 18 months (mean difference 0.16, 95% confidence interval: 0.04 to 0.27; p = 0.009). DISCUSSION: An 18-month multimodal intervention for older adults at risk of dementia could improve their cognitive function. The trial was registered in the Clinical Trial Registration System (UMIN000041938). Highlights: Japan-Multimodal Intervention Trial for Prevention of Dementia (J-MINT) PRIME Tamba was a randomized controlled trial to prevent dementia. We provided a multifactorial intervention based on the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) trial methodology. The primary outcome, the cognitive composite score, improved with our intervention. Executive function/processing speed and memory improved in the intervention group. Intervention adherence was high, and no serious adverse events occurred.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a 12-week individual cognitive stimulation (iCS) intervention on global cognition, memory, and executive function of older adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Protocolized analysis using data from a multicenter, single-blind, randomized, parallel two-arm RCT of iCS for older adults with probable AD. A sample of 142 people with probable Alzheimer's disease attending 13 Portuguese institutions providing care and support services for older adults were selected. Intervention group (n=72) received 24 iCS sessions, twice a week for 12 weeks. Control group (n=70) maintained their activities as usual. Outcomes included global cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination, and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale), memory (Memory Alteration Test, and Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test), and executive functioning (Frontal Assessment Battery). All participants were assessed at baseline (T0), after the intervention (T1), and 12 weeks follow-up (T2). <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The results showed significant improvements in memory performance at follow-up for the intervention group and greater stability in global cognition in the intervention relative to the control group. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): The current iCS protocol shows effectiveness in cognitive functioning in older adults with probable AD, particularly for memory upon completion of the intervention and at follow-up, adding further support to previous iCS studies showing similar results and to the effectiveness of the current intervention.

N2  - Background: Computerised cognitive training (CCT) can improve the cognitive abilities of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), especially when the CCT contains a learning system, which is a type of machine learning (ML) that automatically selects exercises at a difficulty that corresponds to the person's peak performance and thus enables individualised training. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We developed one individualised CCT (iCCT) with ML and one basic CCT (bCCT) for an active control group (CG). The study aimed to determine whether iCCT in the intervention group (IG) resulted in significantly greater enhancements in overall cognitive functioning for individuals with MCI (age 60+) compared with bCCT in the CG across a 6-month period. This double-blind randomised controlled study was conducted entirely virtually. The 89 participants were community-dwelling people with a psychometric diagnosis of MCI living in Germany. The iCCT stimulates various cognitive functions, especially working memory, visuo-constructional reasoning, and decision-making. The bCCT includes fewer and simpler tasks. Both CCTs were used at home. At baseline and after 6 months, we assessed cognitive functioning with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A mixed-model ANCOVA was conducted as the main analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Both CCTs led to significant increases in average global cognition. The estimated marginal means of the MoCA score increased significantly in the CG by an average of 0.9 points (95% CI [0.2, 1.7]) from 22.3 (SE = 0.25) to 23.2 (SE = 0.41) points (p = 0.018); in the IG, the MoCA score increased by an average of 2.2 points (95% CI [1.4, 2.9]) from 21.9 (SE = 0.26) to 24.1 (SE = 0.42) points (p < 0.001). In a confound-adjusted multiple regression model, the interaction between time and group was statistically significant (F = 4.92; p = 0.029). The effect size was small to medium (partial eta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.057). On average, the participants used the CCTs three times per week with an average duration of 34.9 min per application. The iCCT was evaluated as more attractive and more stimulating than the bCCT. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): By using a multi-tasking CCT three times a week for 30 min, people with MCI living at home can significantly improve their cognitive abilities within 6 months. The use of ML significantly increases the effectiveness of cognitive training and improves user satisfaction.

N2  - Background: Art therapy has a long history of applications in cognitive and motor rehabilitation. More recently, a growing body of scientific literature has highlighted the potential of virtual reality in neurorehabilitation, though it has focused more on the technology itself than on the principles adopted in digital scenarios. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted on 40 patients with stroke, comparing conventional therapy (physical therapy for the upper and lower limbs, for posture and balance, cognitive therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and specific therapy for swallowing, bowel, and bladder dysfunctions) to a protocol in which the upper limb physical therapy was substituted with art therapy administered by means of virtual reality exploiting the so-called Michelangelo effect. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After 12 sessions, patients in the virtual art therapy group showed a significantly greater improvement in independence in activities of daily living, as assessed by the Barthel Index (interaction of time and group: p = 0.001). Significant differences were also found in terms of upper limb muscle strength (Manual Muscle Test, p < 0.01) and reduction in spasticity (Ashworth scale, p = 0.007) in favor of the experimental group. In the virtual art therapy group, the effectiveness of the intervention was significantly correlated with patient participation (Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale: R = 0.41), patient satisfaction (R = 0.60), and the perceived utility of the intervention by the therapist (R = 0.43). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These findings support the efficacy of virtual art therapy leveraging the Michelangelo effect. Further studies should also focus on cognitive domains that could benefit from this type of approach.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 by the authors.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Background: Dementia and mild cognitive impairment are significant contributors to disability and dependency in older adults. Current treatments for managing these conditions are limited. Exergaming, a novel technology-driven intervention combining physical exercise with cognitive tasks, is a potential therapeutic approach. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To assess the effects of exergaming interventions on physical and cognitive outcomes, and activities of daily living, in people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>Search Method(s): On 22 December 2023, we searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO (World Health Organization) meta-register the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal. <ovid:br/>Selection Criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited individuals diagnosed with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Exergaming interventions involved participants being engaged in physical activity of at least moderate intensity, and used immersive and non-immersive virtual reality (VR) technology and real-time interaction. We planned to classify comparators as inactive control group (e.g. no treatment, waiting list), active control group (e.g. standard treatment, non-specific active control), or alternative treatment (e.g. physical activity, computerised cognitive training). Outcomes were to be measured using validated instruments. <ovid:br/>Data Collection and Analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool RoB 2, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We consulted a third author if required. Where possible, we pooled outcome data using a fixed-effect or random-effects model. We expressed treatment effects as standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When data could not be pooled, we presented a narrative synthesis. <ovid:br/>Main Result(s): We included 11 studies published between 2014 and 2023. Six of these studies were pre-registered. Seven studies involved 308 participants with mild cognitive impairment, and five studies included 228 individuals with dementia. One of the studies presented data for both MCI and dementia separately. Most comparisons exhibited a high risk or some concerns of bias. We have only low or very low certainty about all the results presented below. Effects of exergaming interventions for people with dementia. Compared to a control group. Exergaming may improve global cognitive functioning at the end of treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD 1.47, 95% 1.04 to 1.90; 2 studies, 113 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming at the end of treatment on global physical functioning (SMD -0.20, 95% -0.57 to 0.17; 2 studies, 113 participants) or activities of daily living (ADL) (SMD -0.28, 95% -0.65 to 0.09; 2 studies, 113 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about adverse effects due to the small sample size and no events. Findings are based on two studies (113 participants), but data could not be pooled; both studies reported no adverse reactions linked to the intervention or control group. Compared to an alternative treatment group. At the end of treatment, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming on global physical functioning (SMD 0.14, 95% -0.30 to 0.58; 2 studies, 85 participants) or global cognitive functioning (SMD 0.11, 95% -0.33 to 0.55; 2 studies, 85 participants). For ADL, only one study was available (n = 67), which provided low-certainty evidence of little to no difference between exergaming and exercise. The evidence is very uncertain about adverse effects of exergaming compared with alternative treatment (RR 7.50, 95% CI 0.41 to 136.52; 2 studies, 2/85 participants). Effects of exergaming interventions for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Compared to a control group. Exergaming may improve global cognitive functioning at the end of treatment for people with MCI, but the evidence is very uncertain, (SMD 0.79, 95% 0.05 to 1.53; 2 studies, 34 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming at the end of treatment on global physical functioning (SMD 0.27, 95% -0.41 to 0.94; 2 studies, 34 participants) and ADL (SMD 0.51, 95% -0.01 to 1.03; 2 studies, 60 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming on adverse effects due to a small sample size and no events (0/14 participants). Findings are based on one study. Compared to an alternative treatment group. The evidence is very uncertain about global physical functioning at the end of treatment. Only one study was included (n = 45). For global cognitive functioning, we included four studies (n = 235 participants), but due to considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 96%), we could not pool results. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming on global cognitive functioning. No study evaluated ADL outcomes. The evidence is very uncertain about adverse effects of exergaming due to the small sample size and no events (n = 123 participants). Findings are based on one study. Authors' conclusions: Overall, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming on global physical and cognitive functioning, and ADL. There may be an improvement in global cognitive functioning at the end of treatment for both people with dementia and people with MCI, but the evidence is very uncertain. The potential benefit is observed only when exergaming is compared with a control intervention (e.g. usual care, listening to music, health education), and not when compared with an alternative treatment with a specific effect, such as physical activity (e.g. standing and sitting exercises or cycling). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of exergaming on adverse effects. All sessions took place in a controlled and supervised environment. Therefore, we do not know if exergaming can be safely used in a home environment, unsupervised.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the feasibility of the RehaCom cognitive rehabilitation software in illiterate and low-educated individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its clinical effectiveness in improving cognitive functions. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Twenty illiterate or low-educated individuals with MCI were randomly assigned to an intervention (IG; n=10) and control group (CG; n=10). The IG participated in the cognitive enhancement program for 6 weeks, twice a week and a duration of 50-60 min for each session, while the CG did not receive any kind of intervention. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The two groups were demographically matched. The IG successfully completed all sessions of the cognitive enhancement program. A within-subject comparison between baseline and post-intervention assessment of cognitive functions indicated that the IG improved significantly on all administered neuropsychological tests, in contrast to the CG, whose performance remained stable between baseline and final assessment. A between-group comparison found statistically significant differences between the IG and CG groups on the Hindi Mental State Examination, Mini-Mental State Examination, and on delayed memory and recognition tasks, in favor of the IG. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): The findings of the present study support the feasibility of applying computerized cognitive enhancement programs to illiterate and low-educated individuals. Moreover, these programs appear to contribute positively to improving the cognitive functions of this population group. In order to generalize and confirm similar findings in a broader population of illiterate and low-educated individuals, future studies should include larger samples, possibly with longer duration of treatment and control groups that will receive non-targeted interventions as placebo interventions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of various therapy methods in elderly individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), taking into account the degree of memory loss and the severity of the injury. The study was conducted in 2022 in Moscow, Russia, and Sofia, Bulgaria, involving six clinics. A total of 200 elderly patients with TBI participated in the study, with a mean age of 72years. Patients were categorized into groups based on the degree of memory loss and severity of the injury. Standardized tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, and Free, and Cued Selective Reminding Test, were used to assess cognitive functions. The Progressive Learning Test evaluated patients' ability to memorize and reproduce information over time. Groups receiving physical therapy and cognitive rehabilitation showed statistically significant improvement in cognitive functions compared to other therapy methods. Specifically, the mean score of the MMSE in these groups increased by 7 points (p<.001). Patients with more severe memory loss demonstrated more pronounced improvement in cognitive functions following the integrated therapy approach. The mean MMSE score increased by 10 points (p<.001), whereas in patients with milder memory loss, the growth was less significant (mean increase of 5 points, p<.05). Groups receiving physical therapy and cognitive rehabilitation consistently demonstrated significantly better results compared to speech therapy and psychological support throughout the study period.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The British Psychological Society.

N2  - Background: Maintenance of physical function, mobility, and independent living are important goals for older adults. However, concerns about falling (CaF) play a central role in the vicious cycle of CaF, inflammation, loss of muscle mass, and decreasing physical function ultimately resulting in negative health outcomes. CaF, like other states of chronic stress and anxiety, can be considered as enduring adverse stimuli affecting the stress systems and the inflammatory system. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether a reduction of CaF leads to a reduction of stress and therefore possibly reduces chronic low-grade inflammation. Understanding the role and directionality of the effects of inflammation on CaF increases our understanding of age-related loss of mobility and physical function. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In this study, community-dwelling older adults, aged 70 years and older, will be randomly assigned to either a 4-month, multi-component intervention with exercise training and cognitive-behavioral components or to a sham control group with light stretching exercises, cognitive training, and educational health lectures. For the operationalization of specific CaF, the Falls Efficacy Scale-International will be used. Stress and related psychological symptoms will be monitored using established self-reports and by measuring salivary cortisol. Concentrations of C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, interleukin 10, and tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha, as well as gene expression of selected inflammatory transcripts, will be used as surrogate parameters of the inflammatory status at baseline, after the 4-month intervention and 8-month follow-up. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): This study will be the first to test whether CaF are related with stress system activity or reactivity or with markers of inflammation in the context of a multi-component intervention with exercise training and cognitive-behavioral components addressing CaF. The reduction of specific CaF or general psychological symptoms should reverse alterations in stress systems, and / or slow down low-grade inflammation. Changes in activity, as well as psychological and biological pathways leading from CaF to muscle loss will be measured, to disentangle the individual contribution to sarcopenia, and to provide an additional pathway to break or slow-down the vicious cycle of CaF and sarcopenia.

N2  - Objective: To determine the effects of exergames by using Xbox 360 Kinect on cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methodology: This randomized control trial included 56 MCI older adults who were randomly divided into experimental group (n=28) and control group (n=28), using coin and toss method. The experimental group performed X-box 360 Kinect games while the control group received stretching and strength training exercises of upper and lower extremity. The intervention was of 30 min per day/5 days per week for six weeks. Mini-mental state examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail making Test A and B, Verbal fluency (Semantic/Phenomic) were used as outcome measures at baseline and after six weeks of intervention. Data were analyzed by SPSS 26. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Final analysis included 51 subjects, out of which 26 were in experimental group with mean age 62.85+/-5.56 years, 16 (61.5%) males and 10 (38.5%) females. In control, there were 25 subjects with mean age 63.24+/-5.12 years, 15 (60.0%) males and 10 (40.0%) females. Inter-group analysis showed significant improvement in outcomes measures after six weeks of intervention in experimental group (p<0.05). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Exergames showed positive effects on cognitive domains in older adults with MCI.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023, Pakistan Medical Association.

N2  - Background: Executive dysfunction such as inattention or forgetfulness can lead to disruptions in a person's daily functioning and quality of life. Objective/Hypothesis: This triple-blinded randomized clinical trial assessed the efficacy of bifrontal (over the forehead) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) concurrent with cognitive training to improve cognitive performance in a healthy sample. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Fifty-eight participants were randomly assigned to one of three stimulation conditions (2 mA left anode-right cathode, 2 mA right anode-left cathode, or sham), which was administered with cognitive training tasks 3x/week over 12 weeks with assessments at baseline, midpoint (6 weeks), and post-training (12 weeks). We assessed cognitive performance, functional connectivity, and the influence of individual differences in training advancement. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Forty participants completed training. We found that at midpoint and post, all groups improved significantly on overall cognitive performance. The left anode group's attention & vigilance score improved significantly at post, but the other two groups did not. Greater attention training advancement predicted attention improvement by post, most notably in the left anode group. Finally, within-network connectivity decreased in the control network and increased in the somatomotor network across all groups. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These results suggest that, given cognitive training, the left anode montage is more effective at improving attention than the right anode montage and sham. Future research may focus on the application of the left anode montage during cognitive training to assess its effectiveness in improving cognition in neuropsychiatric disorders.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024

N2  - Multifactorial lifestyle approaches could be more effective than a single factor for maintaining cognitive function. This study investigated the association of combining cognitively stimulating leisure activities (CSLAs), including puzzles, quizzes, and cognitive training games, with intake of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and arachidonic acid (ARA), on cognitive function in the older Japanese individuals without dementia. Participants were community-dwelling Japanese individuals without a self-reported history of dementia (n = 906, aged 60-88 years) from datasets of a 2-year longitudinal study (baseline: 2006-2008 and follow-up: 2008-2010). CSLA engagement and LCPUFA intake were divided into high and low groups according to frequency (>=once/week and <once/week) for CSLA engagement and median intake level for LCPUFA intake according to sex, then categorized into four groups. The associations of multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for a cognitive decline, shown as a decrease in the Mini-Mental State Examination score by 2 or more points, and the combination of CSLA engagement with LCPUFA intake were assessed using a multiple logistic regression model. Subgroup analysis involved participants with low DHA and EPA intakes (n = 303; median intake, 325 mg/day), mirroring those in North America. The HIGH-CSLA/HIGH-ARA group cumulatively yielded a lower OR for cognitive decline (0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.70) than did the LOW-CSLA/LOW-ARA group (p for trend = 0.001). In the subgroup analysis, the OR for the HIGH-CSLA/HIGH-DHA group was notably reduced (0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.87; p for trend = 0.025) compared with the LOW-CSLA/LOW-DHA group. High CSLA engagement frequency combined with high ARA intake may cumulatively reduce the risk of cognitive decline among older Japanese individuals. Furthermore, combining CSLA engagement frequency with DHA intake could have a positive association with maintaining cognitive function among older individuals, particularly those with low DHA and EPA intakes.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Tokuda, Horikawa, Nishita, Kaneda, Obata, Rogi, Izumo, Nakai, Shimokata and Otsuka.

N2  - The efficacy of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) in patients with vascular cognitive impairment has not been explored, and no studies investigating CST in the convalescent rehabilitation phase have been reported. This study examined the effect of CST on the cognitive function of patients with vascular cognitive impairment. A randomized controlled, assessor-blinded, single-centered trial with two parallel groups was conducted in a convalescent rehabilitation hospital. Twenty participants were randomly allocated to CST (n=10) and control (n=10) groups. Participants in the CST group underwent two CST sessions a day, five times a week for 8 weeks, in addition to conventional rehabilitation. Participants in the control group underwent conventional rehabilitation only. The primary outcome was the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and the outcome between the groups was compared using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). The mean (standard deviation) scores of MMSE increased by 3.50 (3.08) points and 4.50 (1.61) points from baseline to the end of the study (week 8) in the CST and control groups, respectively. The GLMM showed a significant effect of TIME on MMSE (F=21.121, P<0.001), whereas no significant effect on MMSE was observed for GROUP (intervention vs. control, P=0.817) or the interaction term (TIMExGROUP, P=0.649). Although a significant improvement in cognitive function was observed in each group, no significant effect of CST was evident. This result indicates that the effect may have been masked by improvements caused by natural history or rehabilitation. Future studies with a sufficient sample size are required to confirm the findings.

N2  - Stroke is a highly disabling condition, for which music therapy is regularly used in rehabilitation. One possible mechanism for the effects of music therapy is the motivational aspect of music, for example regarding treatment adherence based on improved mood. In this study, changes in motivation related to Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) techniques during rehabilitation in the subacute phase after stroke will be investigated. Using a randomised within-subjects cross-over design, the effects of two NMT techniques and related motivational indices will be investigated. Data will be collected at three timepoints: baseline (TP1), after being randomised into groups and receiving NMT or standard care (TP2), and then at a third time point after the cross-over and having received both conditions (TP3). This design allows to counteract order effects, time effects due to spontaneous and/or nonlinear recovery, as well as single-subject comparisons in a relatively heterogeneous sample. Twenty adult participants who have experienced a supratentorial ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke and are experiencing upper-limb impairments and/or cognitive deficits will be included. Behavioural measures of motor function, cognition, and quality of life will be collected, along with self-reported indices of overall motivation. The study outcomes will have implications for the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of music therapy in stroke recovery, more specifically regarding the relevance of motivational states in neurorehabilitation.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors

N2  - BACKGROUND: Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) has demonstrated efficacy in patients with cognitive impairment. However, activation patterns and mechanisms of iTBS for post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) remain insufficiently understood. <ovid:br/>OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the activation patterns and potential benefits of using iTBS in patients with PSCI. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A total of forty-four patients with PSCI were enrolled and divided into an iTBS group (iTBS and cognitive training) or a control group (cognitive training alone). Outcomes were assessed based on the activation in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), as well as Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA) and the modified Barthel Index (MBI). <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Thirty-eight patients completed the interventions and assessments. Increased cortical activation was observed in the iTBS group after the interventions, including the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), left frontopolar cortex (FPC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Both groups showed significant improvements in LOTCA and MBI after the interventions (p<0.05). Furthermore, the iTBS group augmented superior improvement in the total score of MBI and LOTCA compared to the control group, especially in visuomotor organization and thinking operations (p<0.05). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): iTBS altered activation patterns and improved cognitive function in patients with PSCI. The activation induced by iTBS may contribute to the improvement of cognitive function.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024-The authors. Published by IOS Press.

N2  - Background: Growing evidence supports the clinical utility of amyloid PET, however, whether patients at risk for dementia use knowledge of their brain amyloid status to alter their health behaviors remains unclear. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To explore the effect of amyloid PET results disclosure on self-reported health behaviors in patients with mild cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Self-reported health behaviors were a secondary outcome of the Return of Amyloid Imaging Scan Results (RAISR) randomized clinical trial of amyloid PET results disclosure for individuals with mild cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): Academic medical center. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): RAISR study participants included 82 patients with mild cognitive impairment who were 92% non-Hispanic white, 59% male, and, on average, 73 +/- 8.61 years old with 16.25 +/- 2.49 years of education. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): Participants were assigned to a scan group with the opportunity to have an amyloid PET scan and learn their results or to a control group consisting only of a mild cognitive impairment education session and no opportunity for an amyloid PET scan. Measurements: A 14-item health behavior questionnaire supplemented with qualitative data from the open-ended text entries to describe "other" health behaviors and follow-up semi-structured interviews. Baseline assessments were conducted prior to group assignment. For the present analysis, 71 participants had available data and scan group participants were divided by amyloid status, creating three groups for comparison: amyloid positive, amyloid negative, and control (no scan). <ovid:br/>Result(s): Over 12 months of follow-up, no significant differences were observed in lifestyle, vitamin/supplement use, stress reduction activities, cognitive stimulation, or advance directive completion. Amyloid-negative participants were less likely than controls to consider long-term care insurance (63.6% vs. 89.2%; P =.025), and to endorse behaviors classified as "other" (36.4% vs. 64.9%; P = 0.037). After adjusting for education level, gender, and Mini-Mental State Exam score, logistic regression showed that amyloid-negative patients were 74% less likely than controls to report "other" behaviors (OR = 0.26, 95% CI [0.08, 0.85], P = 0.025), and 78% less likely to consider long-term care insurance (OR= 0.22, 95% CI [0.06, 0.86], P = 0.03). Qualitative analysis of open-ended questionnaire data and supplemental interviews with scan group participants revealed "other" activities to include changes in areas like employment, driving, and residential status, and engagement in other non-medical activities (e.g., pursuing bucket lists). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This exploratory analysis of health-related behavior changes following amyloid PET disclosure suggests that the value of knowing one's brain amyloid status may differ by scan result and encompass actions that focus more on maximizing quality of life than promoting cognitive health.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Serdi 2024.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the effect and potential mechanism of cognitive intervention and rehabilitation training in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus complicated with mild cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): In this study, 128 elderly patients with diabetes mellitus complicated with mild cognitive impairment were randomly divided into the control group and the training group. The effects of the two groups were compared before and after the cognitive intervention. The expression of miR-134-5p was assessed by qRT-PCR. The relationships between miR-134-5p and Mini-Mental State Examination Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale were evaluated. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): After 3-month management, the Mini-Mental State Examination Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, the Chinese version of the diabetes self-efficacy rating scale, and WHO quality of life brief were improved in both control group and training group, and the training group showed better improvement. Cognitive intervention and rehabilitation training restricted the expression of miR-134-5p. The levels of miR-134-5p were pertinent to cognitive function. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Cognitive intervention and rehabilitation training might prevent the development of diabetes mellitus complicated with mild cognitive impairment by inhibiting miR-134-5p.

N2  - Introduction: Impairments in bottom-up perceptual processing have been associated to the age-related cognitive decline. Digital cognitive training focusing on bottom-up and/or top-down processes have been studied as a tool to remediate age-related cognitive decline. However, the most effective training type and order of application remain unclear. <ovid:br/>Method(s): One hundred and fifteen older adults were randomly assigned to 40 h of bottom-up then top-down or top-down then bottom-up digital cognitive training or an active control group. We evaluated cognition at baseline, after 20 h and 40 h of training and at follow-up using a mixed-model analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Global cognition improved, for the top-down group, after 20 h of training (p = 0.04; d = 0.7) and for all three groups after 40 h. The improvement in global cognition remained five months after the bottom-up/ top-down training (p = 0.009; d = 4.0). There were also improvements in the recall cognitive domain, after 20 h of training, for the bottom-up group and, after 40 h, for all three groups. Gains were observed in verbal fluency after 40 h of training for both therapeutic groups. Processing speed was significantly slower, after 20 h of training, for the control and bottom-up groups and, after 40 h, only for the control group. Emotion recognition improved, after 20 h, for the control group as compared to the therapeutic groups. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These results indicate that the bottom-up/top-down training has the most endurable effects, which reveals the importance of the order of application of the exercises for gains in cognition in older adults.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: The increase in population aging highlights the growing prevalence of mild cognitive impairment, prompting the adoption of interventions that combine physical exercise and cognitive training to improve health and cognitive performance in older adults. The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of a combined program on physical and cognitive health in older people with cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A 12-week randomized controlled clinical trial involving 95 participants (aged 72.12 +/- 4.25 years), 47 individuals participated in a control group (CG) that only underwent cognitive stimulation, while 48 individuals were in an experimental group (EG) that participated in a combined program. Balance was measured using the Tinetti scale, upper body strength was assessed with the arm curl test, lower body strength was evaluated with the 30-s chair stand test, flexibility was tested using the back scratch test and chair sit-and-reach test, physical function was measured with the Timed Up and Go test, cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination, cognitive impairment was evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, verbal fluency was tested with the Isaac test, and executive functions were assessed using the Trail Making Test. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The results of the study show significant improvements in both physical and cognitive aspects, such as balance, gait, upper and lower body strength, flexibility, physical function, cognitive function, cognitive impairment, verbal fluency, and executive functions in the group that carried out the intervention compared to the control group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): A combined program for older individuals with mild cognitive impairment leads to enhancements in physical and cognitive health. These improvements underscore the importance of integrating physical exercise with cognitive training as an effective strategy for enhancing overall health and quality of life in older adults.

N2  - Background: In recent years, an increasing number of studies have examined the potential efficacy of cognitive training procedures in individuals with normal ageing and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The aims of this study were to (i) evaluate the efficacy of the cognitive Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System (VRRS) combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to placebo tDCS stimulation combined with VRRS and (ii) to determine how to prolong the beneficial effects of the treatment. A total of 109 subjects with MCI were assigned to 1 of 5 study groups in a randomized controlled trial design: (a) face-to-face (FTF) VRRS during anodal tDCS followed by cognitive telerehabilitation (TR) (clinic-atDCS-VRRS+Tele@H-VRRS); (b) FTF VRRS during placebo tDCS followed by TR (clinic-ptDCS-VRRS+Tele@H-VRRS); (c) FTF VRRS followed by cognitive TR (clinic-VRRS+Tele@H-VRRS); (d) FTF VRRS followed by at-home unstructured cognitive stimulation (clinic-VRRS+@H-UCS); and (e) FTF cognitive treatment as usual (clinic-TAU). <ovid:br/>Result(s): An improvement in episodic memory was observed after the end of clinic-atDCS-VRRS (p < 0.001). We found no enhancement in episodic memory after clinic-ptDCS-VRRS or after clinic-TAU. Moreover, the combined treatment led to prolonged beneficial effects (clinic-atDCS-VRRS+Tele@H-VRRS vs. clinic-ptDCS-VRRS+Tele@H-VRRS: p = 0.047; clinic-atDCS-VRRS+Tele@H-VRRS vs. clinic-VRRS+Tele@H-VRRS: p = 0.06). <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): The present study provides preliminary evidence supporting the use of individualized VRRS combined with anodal tDCS and cognitive telerehabilitation for cognitive rehabilitation.

N2  - Background: Cognitive-motor training in form of exergames has been found to be feasible and effective for the improvement of motor and cognitive functioning in older adults and several patient populations. Exergame training under unstable conditions might increase the proprioceptive resources needed and thus might be a superior training approach compared to exergame training on stable ground for stroke patients, who often have proprioceptive deficits. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): Aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and effects of exergame-based cognitive-motor training on a labile platform on physical and cognitive functioning in stroke inpatients. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This is two-armed pilot randomized controlled trial taking place in an inpatient neurologic rehabilitation clinic. A total of 30 persons that are undergoing inpatient rehabilitation due to a stroke will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). Participants of the IG will receive exergame-based motor-cognitive training on a labile surface, whereas participants of the CG will train on a stable surface. Primary outcome is feasibility comprising measures of adherence, attrition, safety and usability. Secondary outcomes will be measures of cognitive (psychomotor speed, inhibition, selective attention, cognitive flexibility, brain activity) and motor (functional mobility, gait speed, balance, proprioception) functioning. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Data collection started in February 2024 and is expected to be completed by August 2024. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This is the first study looking into exergame training on labile surface in stroke patients. It will give valuable insights into the feasibility and potential added value of this type of training and thus inform further implementation efforts in the context of inpatient rehabilitation.

N2  - Background: People with Parkinson's disease (PD) are very sensitive to the effects of stress. The prevalence of stress-related neuropsychiatric symptoms is high, and acute stress worsens motor symptoms. Animal studies suggest that chronic stress may accelerate disease progression, but evidence for this in humans is lacking. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) train participants to focus on the present moment, on purpose and without judgement. Previous studies suggest that MBIs may alleviate stress and reduce depression and anxiety in PD. We aim to demonstrate the efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) as a non-pharmacologic treatment strategy for neuropsychiatric (and motor) symptoms in PD, and to identify the mechanisms underlying stress and stress reduction in PD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), we investigate whether 8 weeks of MBCT, as compared to care as usual, can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in people with PD. We aim to include 124 PD patients, who experience mild-moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression, are eligible for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and naive to mindfulness, and who have a disease duration <= 10 years. Every participant is followed for 12 months. Clinical and biochemical assessments take place at baseline (T0), after 2 months (T1), and after 12 months (T2); MRI assessments take place at T0 and T2. Our primary outcome is the total score on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at T1, while correcting for the HADS score at T0, age, and gender. Beyond testing the effects of MBCT on symptoms of anxiety and depression in PD, we explore whether MBCT: (1) has an effect on motor symptom severity, (2) influences cerebral and biochemical markers of stress, and (3) leads to a change in biomarkers of PD progression. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): MIND-PD is one of the first RCTs with a 1-year follow-up to investigate the effects of MBCT on symptoms of anxiety and depression in PD, and to explore possible mechanisms underlying stress and stress reduction in PD. Insight into these mechanisms can pave the way to new treatment methods in the future. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05779137.

N2  - Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a non-pharmaceutical multimodal intervention program consisting of physical exercise, cognitive stimulation, and health education in a group setting to slow the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). <ovid:br/>Method(s): A single-arm interventional study was conducted on 27 patients with MCI. To evaluate the efficacy of the intervention program, a pre-post analysis was performed using EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI), 5 Cog test, depression, and physical performance before and after the 8-month intervention. Additionally, propensity score and the semi-Bayes analyses were performed to compare the intervention program with standard medical care, using the external control patients' data for MMSE scores. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Twenty-four patients completed the intervention program. During the study period, although EQ-5D and MMSE scores remained unchanged (mean change 0.02 [95 % confidence interval (CI): -0.004, 0.04], 0.5 [-0.2, 1.3]), CFI and the subcategories of 5Cog (attention and reasoning) improved (mean change -1.23 [-2.24, -0.21], 4.3 [0.9, 7.7], 3.0 [0.4, 5.6]). In the additional analysis comparing changes in MMSE scores, patients who underwent the intervention program had less decline than the external control patients (mean change -1.7 [-2.1, -1.3]) with an observed mean difference of 2.25 [1.46, 3.03], and propensity score-adjusted difference of 2.26 [1.46, 3.05]. The semi-Bayesian approach also suggested that the intervention slowed the progression of MCI. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): A non-pharmaceutical multimodal intervention program could contribute to slowing cognitive decline in patients with MCI.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors

N2  - Dementia is an increasing challenge for health care and social system in developed countries. Interventions with a cognitive focus, also using assistive technology, are leading to promising results in improving cognitive and behavior symptoms in individuals with dementia. Aim of our study was to evaluate the combined effects of the standard cognitive training in addition to web-based rehabilitation in dementia people living in a nursing home. We have studied twenty dementia people (10 females and 10 males) with a mild to moderate cognitive decline (MMSE 25 +/- 3.4) associated to moderate behavioral alterations, and mainly due to vascular causes. These patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups (experimental or standard treatment-namely the control group). All participants in the experimental group completed the specific training, consisting of 24 sessions of web-based cognitive training, for 8 weeks, in addition to standard rehabilitation. Each participant was evaluated by a skilled neuropsychologist before and after each treatment. The experimental group had a statistically significant change of the Geriatric Depression Scale (p = 0.03), Constructive Apraxia (p < 0.001), Matrices Attentive (p = 0.01), and Mini Mental State Examination (p = 0.04). Web-based cognitive rehabilitation can be useful in improving cognitive performance, besides psychological well-being, in demented individuals living in home care.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016, Springer-Verlag Italia.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of cognitive stimulation (mahjong) and physical exercise (tai chi [TC]) on cognitive performance in persons with dementia. DESIGN: Cluster-randomized open-label controlled design. SETTING: Nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred ten residents, most of whom were cholinesterase-inhibitor naive. Inclusion criteria were Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) = 10-24 and suffering from at least very mild dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating >= 0.5). Exclusion criteria were being bedbound, audio/visual impairment, regular activity participation before study, or contraindications for physical or group activities. INTERVENTIONS: Homes were randomized into three conditions (mahjong, TC, and simple handicrafts [control]). Activities were conducted three times weekly for 12 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was MMSE. Secondary outcomes were immediate/delayed recall, categorical fluency, and digit span. Various biological risk factors, including apolipoprotein E [Latin Small Letter Open E]4 allele, were included as covariates. Measures were collected at 0 (baseline), 3 (posttreatment), 6, and 9 months. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Intent-to-treat analyses were performed using mixed-effects regression. Mahjong's effect varied by time for MMSE, delayed recall, and forward digit span. TC had similar effects but not for delayed recall. The typical pattern was that control participants deteriorated while mahjong and TC participants maintained their abilities over time, leading to enlarged treatment effects as time progressed. By 9 months, mahjong and TC differed from control by 4.5 points (95% confidence interval: 2.0-6.9; d = 0.48) and 3.7 points (95% confidence interval: 1.4-6.0; d = 0.40), respectively, on MMSE. No treatment effects were observed for immediate recall and backward digit span. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Mahjong and TC can preserve functioning or delay decline in certain cognitive domains, even in those with significant cognitive impairment.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: We examined the efficacy of a multidomain intervention in preventing cognitive decline among Japanese older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Participants aged 65-85 years with MCI were randomized into intervention (management of vascular risk factors, exercise, nutritional counseling, and cognitive training) and control groups. The primary outcome was changes in the cognitive composite score over a period of 18 months. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Of 531 participants, 406 completed the trial. The between-group difference in composite score changes was 0.047 (95% CI: -0.029 to 0.124). Secondary analyses indicated positive impacts of interventions on several secondary health outcomes. The interventions appeared to be particularly effective for individuals with high attendance during exercise sessions and those with the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele and elevated plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein levels. DISCUSSION: The multidomain intervention showed no efficacy in preventing cognitive decline. Further research on more efficient strategies and suitable target populations is required. Highlights: This trial evaluated the efficacy of multidomain intervention in individuals with MCI. The trial did not show a significant difference in preplanned cognitive outcomes. Interventions had positive effects on a wide range of secondary health outcomes. Those with adequate adherence or high risk of dementia benefited from interventions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors.

N2  - Background and Aims: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a widespread condition in older individuals, posing significant risk of dementia. However, limited research has been conducted to explore effective interventions and clarify their impact at the neural level. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of computerized cognitive training (CCT) and explore the associated neural mechanisms in preventing dementia in older individuals with MCI, with a view to inform future intervention efforts. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We reviewed the effects of CCT on biomarker outcomes in older adults with MCI. The search was conducted for studies published between 2010 and May 10, 2023, using three search engines: PubMed, Scopus, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. The inclusion criteria were as follows: studies that involved participants diagnosed with MCI, included CCT, included quantitative assessment of biomarker results, and conducted randomized controlled trials. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Sixteen studies that used biomarkers, including magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and blood or salivary biomarkers, were extracted. The results showed that CCT caused changes in structure and function within the main brain network, including the default mode network, and decreased both theta rhythm activity on EEG and prefrontal activity on fNIRS, with improvement in cognitive function. Furthermore, CCT combined with physical exercise showed more significant structural and functional changes in extensive brain regions compared with CCT alone. Virtual reality-based cognitive training improved not only executive function but also instrumental activities of daily living. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): CCT causes functional and structural changes in extensive brain regions and improves cognitive function in older adults with MCI. Our findings highlight the potential of individualized intervention methods and biomarker assessment according to the specific causes of MCI. Future research should aim to optimize these personalized therapeutic strategies to maximize the benefits of CCT in older adults with MCI.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors.

N2  - Objective: Investigate the impact of combined computerized cognitive training and occupational therapy on individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). <ovid:br/>Method(s): We randomly assigned 118 MCI patients into two groups: a combined intervention group (n = 37) and a control group (n = 81), the latter receiving standard nursing care. The intervention group additionally underwent 12 weeks of computerized cognitive training and occupational therapy. Blind assessors evaluated cognitive performance, anxiety, depression, and daily living activities before the intervention, post-intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that the sMoCA scores, HAMA scores, and ADL scores of the experimental group at T2 (post-intervention) and T3 (3-month follow-up) were higher than those of the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.026). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Computerized cognitive training combined with occupational therapy can improve patients' cognitive status, enhance their compliance with continuing care, and maintain their anxiety and self-care ability at a stable level.

N2  - Aims: Previous neuroimaging studies of vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia (VCIND), have reported functional alterations, but far less is known about the effects of cognitive training on functional connectivity (FC) of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) and how they relate to intervention-related cognitive improvement. This study provides comprehensive research on the changes in intra- and inter-brain functional networks in patients with VCIND who received computerized cognitive training, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We prospectively collected 60 patients with VCIND who were randomly divided into the training group (N = 30) receiving computerized cognitive training and the control group (N = 30) receiving fixed cognitive training. Functional MRI scans and cognitive assessments were performed at baseline, at the 7-week training, and at the 6-month follow-up. Utilizing templates for ICNs, the study employed a linear mixed model to compare intra- and inter-network FC changes between the two groups. Pearson correlation was applied to calculate the relationship between FC and cognitive function. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We found significantly decreased intra-network FC within the default mode network (DMN) following computerized cognitive training at Month 6 (p = 0.034), suggesting a potential loss of functional specialization. Computerized training led to increased functional coupling between the DMN and sensorimotor network (SMN) (p = 0.01) and between the language network (LN) and executive control network (ECN) at Month 6 (p < 0.001), indicating compensatory network adaptations in patients with VCIND. Notably, the intra-LN exhibited enhanced functional specialization after computerized cognitive training (p = 0.049), with significant FC increases among LN regions, which correlated with improvements in neuropsychological measures (p < 0.05), emphasizing the targeted impact of computerized cognitive training on language abilities. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study provides insights into neuroplasticity and adaptive changes resulting from cognitive training in patients with VCIND, with implications for potential therapeutic strategies.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Interventions to prevent or attenuate cognitive decline and dementia in older adults are becoming increasingly important. Recently, cognitive training exercise can be via computer or mobile technology for independent or home use. Recent meta-analysis has reported that Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT) is effective at enhancing cognitive function in healthy older and Alzheimer's disease adults, although little is known about individual characteristics of each computerized program. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): We developed a new CCT named Brain Training Based on Everyday Living (BTEL) to enhance cognitive capacity for Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). We aim to evaluate the efficacy of the BTEL among cognitively healthy old individuals and to explore its concurrent validity and construct concept. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a double-blind study where 106 individuals aged 65 years and older (intervened = 53, control = 53) worked on the active and placebo tasks three times a week over three months (clinical trial: UMIN000048730). The main results were examined using ANCOVA and calculating correlation coefficients. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We found no effect on total score of the three tests; however, there was significant effect for the BTEL on: recognition in MMSE, and immediate recall in HDSR. The tasks are associated with prefrontal cortex. In addition, correlations indicated that each BTEL domain had some validity as a cognitive assessment tool. Different from previous CCT, we determined the neuropsychological characteristics of specific cognitive tasks of the BTEL to a certain degree. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): We found modest efficacy of the BTEL in cognitively healthy old individuals and confirmed its concurrent validity and the conceptual construct.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 - IOS Press.

N2  - Objective: This study examined the effects of a multicomponent intervention program on cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD). <ovid:br/>Method(s): This was a 2-arm, randomized controlled trial in which a multicomponent intervention was applied. Participants were recruited from June 2020 to August 2020, randomization and intervention began in August 2020, and the entire program ended in January 2021. It included cognitive training (mnemonic strategy training) and lifestyle guidance (diet, sleep, and exercise guidance) for 7 weeks. A total of 123 Chinese community-dwelling older adults experiencing MCI or SCD were randomly divided into a multicomponent intervention group (n = 62) and a health education group (n = 61). The global cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The cognitive domains outcomes included memory functions measured using the immediate and delayed tests of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) and Logical Memory Test (LMT), and executive function and attention measured using the Digital Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and Digit Span Test (DST). Data were collected at baseline and postintervention. <ovid:br/>Result(s): For cognitive outcome, the results of linear mixed-effect model showed significant time x group effects in the MMSE (Cohen d = 0.63 [95% CI, 0.27 to 1.00], F = 10.25, P = .002). This study found significant time x group effects in AVLT-immediate (Cohen d = 0.47 [95% CI, 0.11 to 0.83], F = 8.18, P = .005), AVLTdelayed (Cohen d = 0.45 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.81], F = 4.59, P = .034), LMT-delayed (Cohen d = 0.71 [95% CI, 0.34 to 1.07], F = 4.59, P = .034), DSST (Cohen d = 0.27 [95% CI, -0.08 to 0.63], F = 4.83, P = .030), and DST (Cohen d = 0.69 [95% CI, 0.33 to 1.05], F = 8.58, P = .004). Conclusions and Implications: The results support the feasibility and effectiveness of the multicomponent intervention program in improving cognitive function in communitydwelling older adults at risk of dementia. The high adherence of this program shows its potential for promotion in the community and supports a larger and longer trial.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Physicians Postgraduate Press Inc..

N2  - Background: Developing evidence for the use of psychosocial interventions for people with dementia is a research priority. This pilot study aimed to provide variability estimates for a set of outcome measures that would inform the development of a more extensive controlled study. The larger study will seek to explore the effect of attending a lifelong learning intervention for people with dementia compared to receiving treatment as usual. This pilot and feasibility stage also analysed how data collectors and researchers evaluated the use of the outcome measures in a sample of people with mild to moderate dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Before initiating the pilot study, a participant consultation was conducted with people with dementia, who attend a lifelong learning service known as a dementia school, and their teachers. From this consultation, the research outcomes identified were the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Quality-of-Life Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD), General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE), Rosenberg self-esteem scale, and the Friendship scale. The following study was divided into two steps. In step 1, participants were people with dementia attending a dementia school (intervention group) or usual services (control group). The participants were tested at baseline and at a 6-month follow-up. Data were collected between November 2018 and July 2019. In step 2, feasibility and acceptability issues with the recruitment of participants, data collection process, and outcome measures, identified in step 1, were evaluated through a data collector focus group. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Fifty-five people with dementia were included in the analysis. Step 1 provided estimates of changes from baseline to follow-up, and ancillary standard deviations were supplied for all outcome measures. Step 2 provided reflections on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, data collection, and outcome measures. This included views on how people with dementia experience participating in a test situation. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study provided estimates of change and variability in the outcome measures. Additionally, issues regarding data collection were identified and should be addressed in future studies. The project demonstrated how to support people with dementia to participate in research that is meaningful to them. Trial registration: According to national legislation, registration with a database of clinical studies was optional, as the study evaluated existing activities rather than a clinical intervention.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - Introduction Poststroke cognitive impairment is a common complication in stroke survivors, seriously affecting their quality of life. Therefore, it is crucial to improve cognitive function of patients who had a stroke. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) are non-invasive, safe treatments with great potential to improve cognitive function in poststroke patients. However, further improvements are needed in the effectiveness of a single non-invasive brain stimulation technique for cognitive rehabilitation. This study protocol aims to investigate the effect and neural mechanism of the combination of tDCS and taVNS on cognitive function in patients who had a stroke. Methods and analysis In this single-centre, prospective, parallel, randomised controlled trial, a total of 66 patients with poststroke cognitive impairment will be recruited and randomly assigned (1:1:1) to the tDCS group, the taVNS group and the combination of tDCS and taVNS group. Each group will receive 30 min of treatment daily, five times weekly for 3 weeks. Primary clinical outcome is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Secondary clinical outcomes include the Mini-Mental State Examination, Stroop Colour Word Test, Trail Marking Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test and Modified Barthel Index. All clinical outcomes, functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging will be measured at preintervention and postintervention. Ethics and dissemination The trial has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University (approval no: KY202390). The results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals or at scientific conferences. Trial registration number ChiCTR2300076632.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 BMJ Publishing Group.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the efficacy of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) combined with galantamine in patients with cognitive impairment after stroke and its effect on serum homocysteine (Hcy) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A total of 90 patients with cognitive impairment after the first ischemic stroke were enrolled. They were randomly divided into rTMS+ cognitive rehabilitation group, Galantamine + cognitive rehabilitation group, and rTMS+ Galantamine + cognitive rehabilitation group. All groups received routine medical treatment and limb rehabilitation treatment. The rTMS stimulation site was the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left DLPFC), the magnetic stimulation frequency was 5 Hz, the magnetic stimulation intensity was 80% of the motor threshold level, and 3,000 pulses were given every day. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Fugl-Meyer scale, and modified Barthel index, as well as rehabilitation scale and serum NSE and Hcy were evaluated before and after treatment (after 4 weeks). <ovid:br/>Result(s): After 4 weeks of treatment, the scores of MMSE, MoCa scale, Fugl-Meyer scale, and modified Barthel index in the three groups were significantly higher than those before treatment (all p < 0.05), while the serum NSE and Hcy levels of the three groups were decreased. rTMS+ Galantamine + cognitive rehabilitation group had higher scale scores, and the difference between the three groups was statistically significant compared with the other two groups (all p < 0.05). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Cognitive rehabilitation combined with HF-rTMS and galantamine could improve the cognitive function of patients to the greatest extent, promote the recovery of physical activity, improve the self-care ability of daily life, and effectively reduce the serum HCY and NSE levels in patients with cognitive impairment after stroke. No randomized controlled trials of similar combination treatments have been reported. The better therapeutic effect may be related to the fact that galantamine combined with repetitive transcranial magnetism can activate the brain cholinergic system more extensively, promote brain neural remodeling through long-term potentiation and inhibit local neuroinflammatory responses in brain injury.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Hu, Zhang, Sun, Wang, Xu, Li, Huang and Xiao.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive training is delivered visually and aurally. It is unknown whether self-reported sensory difficulty modifies the effects of cognitive training on cognition. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Participants (N = 2788) in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly Study were randomized to training in memory, reasoning, speed of processing, or control. Differences in the 10-year effect of cognitive training on cognition by self-reported vision and hearing difficulty were assessed using linear mixed effect models. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Benefit (intervention vs. control) of reasoning training was smaller among participants with versus without vision difficulty (difficulty: -0.25, 95% confidence interval: [-0.88, 0.39], no difficulty: 0.58 [0.28, 0.89]). Benefit of memory training was greater for participants with versus without hearing difficulty (difficulty: 0.17 [-0.37, 0.72], no difficulty: -0.20 [-0.65, 0.24]). DISCUSSION: Older adults with sensory loss have increased risk for cognitive decline; benefits of cognitive training may be greater for these individuals. Sensory loss should be considered in training design. Highlights: Memory training was more beneficial for participants with hearing loss. Participants with vision difficulties did not benefit as much from reasoning training. Low accessibility in design and learned compensation strategies may contribute. Consideration of sensory impairment in study design is needed. Inclusion of older adults with sensory impairment in cognitive training is needed.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors.

N2  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediary condition between typical cognitive decline that occurs owing to aging and dementia. It is necessary to implement an intervention to slow the progression from MCI to Alzheimer's disease. This manuscript reports the protocol for a clinical trial on the effect of acupuncture in patients with MCI. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The trial will be a randomized, prospective, parallel-arm, active-controlled trial. Sixty-four patients with MCI will be randomized to the Rehacom or acupuncture group (n = 32 each). The participants in the acupuncture group will receive electroacupuncture at GV24 (Shenting) and GV20 (Baihui) and acupuncture at EX-HN1 (Sishencong) once (30 min) a day, twice per week for 12 weeks. The patients in the Rehacom group will receive computerized cognitive rehabilitation using RehaCom software once (30 min) daily, twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure is the change in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale score. The secondary outcome measures are the Geriatric Depression Scale, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Korean version-cognitive subscale-3 scores, and European Quality of Life Five Dimensions Five Level Scale. The safety outcomes will include the incidence of adverse events, blood pressure, blood chemistry parameters, and pulse rate. The efficacy outcome will be assessed at baseline and at six weeks, 13 weeks, and 24 weeks after baseline. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): The findings of this protocol will provide information regarding the effects of acupuncture on MCI.

N2  - Background: Using the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework, we outline steps taken to implement an evidence-based cognitive training program, Club Connect, in older adults with major depressive disorder in an Older People's Mental Health Service in Sydney, Australia. The primary aim was to explore feasibility (or 'reach'), tolerability (or 'implementation'), and acceptability (or 'adoption'). The secondary aim was to explore the most sensitive clinical outcomes and measurement tools (i.e. 'effectiveness') to inform a formal randomised controlled trial, and to explore the healthcare resources used (i.e. costs) to assist decision-making by health care managers and policy-makers in relation to future resource allocation. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Using a single blinded feasibility design, 40 participants (mean age: 76.13 years, SD: 7.45, range: 65-95 years) were randomised to either (a) Club Connect, a 10-week group-based multifaceted program, comprising psychoeducation and computer-based cognitive training, or (b) a waitlist control group. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Implementing group-based cognitive training within a clinical setting was feasible, well tolerated and accepted by participants. Further, cognitive training, in comparison to the waiting list control, was associated with moderate to very large effect size improvements in depression, stress and inhibition (etap<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.115-0.209). We also found moderate effect size improvements on measures of daily functioning, wellbeing and cognitive flexibility. Small effect size improvements for other cognitive and psychosocial outcomes were also observed. The average cost per person participating in in the intervention was AU$607.50. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our findings support the feasibility of implementing group-based cognitive training into a specialised clinical (public health) setting. This trial was registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12619000195156, 12/02/2019).<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - Introduction Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an important intervenable stage for the prevention of dementia. Hypertension is associated with impaired cognition, and when combined with MCI, it may lead to a poor prognosis. Digital computerised cognitive training (CCT) has recently become a potential instrument for improving cognition, but evidence for its efficacy remains limited. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a digital adaptive CCT intervention in older patients with hypertension and MCI. Methods and analysis The multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, actively -controlled clinical trial will recruit 200 older (>=60 years) patients with hypertension and MCI from 11 hospitals across China. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention group (multidomain adaptative CCT) and active control group (non-adaptive cognitive training) for 12-week cognitive training for 30 min/day and 5 days/week. Those who have completed their 12-week training in the intervention group will be rerandomised into the continuation and discontinuation training groups. All participants will be followed up to 24 weeks. Neuropsychological assessments and structural and functional 7.0 T MRI will be obtained at baseline and at 12-week and 24-week follow-up. The primary outcome is the possible improvement of global cognitive function at 12 weeks, as measured by the Basic Cognitive Aptitude Tests. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include the major cognitive domain function improvement, self-efficacy, mental health, quality of life and MRI measurements of the brain. Ethics and dissemination The trial has been approved by the institutional review board of Beijing Anzhen Hospital and thereafter by all other participating centres. Trial findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. Trial registration number NCT05704270.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - Performance Measure (COPM), Contextual Memory Test (CMT), and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) were used to measure occupational performance, memory, and ADL. The outcome measure scores within groups were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the comparison of outcome measures between the groups was analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test. An alpha level of p=0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 24.0 version was used to analyse the data. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In the present study, a total of 10 participants from the age group of 60-75 years (mean age=67.4 years) were included, and each group (control and experimental) consisted of five participants (3 males and 2 females). The results showed that there was a significant difference (p<0.05) between the post-test scores of the experimental and control groups in COPM-Performance and CMT (p=0.032; p=0.018, respectively). However, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) in the post-test scores of the experimental and control groups in FIM (p=0.347). Further analysis revealed a clinically significant difference between the control and experimental groups in post-test scores. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results of the study concluded that the MSEG intervention is effective in improving memory difficulties in the geriatric population but had a lesser effect on improving ADL performance., Introduction: Memory deficits are one of the common indications of cognitive aging, and they are an essential component for completing day-to-day activities in an effective, timely, and safe manner. Disturbances in memory can have a major impact on an individual's performance in all areas of occupation. Memory alterations have a substantial influence on numerous elements of everyday living, including sentiments and conceptions of self, connections with others, participation in Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and engagement in leisure activities. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): To determine the effectiveness of an occupational therapy Memory Strategy Education Group (MSEG) intervention on memory difficulties and its impact on ADL performance among the geriatric population. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): The present quasi-experimental pre-post-test pilot study was conducted at Department of Occupational Therapy, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu, India. A total of 10 participants aged 60 years and above were recruited from a community setting through convenience sampling and were divided into an experimental group (n=5) and a control group (n=5). The experimental group participants received MSEG intervention, while the control group participants received conventional occupational therapy memory intervention for three weeks.

N2  - Introduction People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at increased risk of decreasing cognitive functioning. Computerised cognitive training (CCT) and nutrition have been shown to improve the cognitive capacities of people with MCI. For each variable, we developed two kinds of interventions specialised for people with MCI (CCT:  individualised' CCT; nutrition: a whole-food, plant-based diet). Additionally, there are two kinds of active control measures (CCT:  basic' CCT; nutrition: a healthy diet following the current guidelines of the German Nutrition Society). The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the two interventions on cognition in people with MCI in a 2x2 randomised controlled trial with German participants. Methods and analysis Participants will be community-dwelling individuals with a psychometric diagnosis of MCI based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination. With N=200, effects with an effect size of f>=0.24 (comparable to Cohen's d>=0.48) can be detected. Screening, baseline, t6 and t12 testing will be conducted via a videoconferencing assessment, telephone, and online survey. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of four groups and will receive a combination of CCT and online nutritional counselling. The CCT can be carried out independently at home on a computer, laptop, or tablet. Nutrition counselling includes 12 online group sessions every fortnight for 1.5 hours. The treatment phase is 6 months with follow-ups after six and 12 months after baseline. Ethics and dissemination All procedures were approved by the Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg Ethics Committee (Ref. 21-318-1-B). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, conference presentations.

N2  - Background: Elevated cortisol levels represent a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), prompting treatments to lower hormone concentrations for preventive or therapeutic purposes. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To assess the efficacy of a comprehensive intervention (CI) in modulating serum cortisol levels in patients with AD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): CI consisted in a 2-month protocol involving cognitive stimulation, psychological support, lifestyle guidance, leisure activities, and socialization. AD subjects were randomly assigned to experimental (EG, n = 45) and control (CG, n = 45) groups. A wide range of sociodemographic, cognitive, psychosocial, and functional conditions were evaluated before, at the conclusion, and 24 months after CI. Data about lifestyle and drug prescription were also recorded. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Baseline evaluations revealed that higher cortisol levels correlated with worse cognitive status (higher CDR and ADAS-Cog values and lower MMSE scores), increased depressive symptoms, and reduced physical and social engagement. Following CI, EG exhibited reduced cortisol levels, improved overall cognitive status, and enhanced verbal working memory and executive functions compared to CG. However, at the 24-month follow-up, EG displayed a rebound effect, characterized by elevated cortisol levels and cognitive decline compared to CG. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These findings strengthen the adverse relationship between excessive cortisol and deficits in cognition/behavior in AD, demonstrate the short-term benefits of CI, and emphasize the potential long-term risks, which may be attributed to the fragile nature of the AD brain. Comprehensive interventions can yield positive results, but careful calibration of type and duration is necessary, considering disease progression and the potential need for re-administration.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 - The authors.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Background: One of the most popular ways to address cognitive decline is cognitive training. The fact that cognitive deterioration is permanent is one of the main issues. This issue might be resolved by preventive cognitive training when it is acute. As a result, this study aims to design and assess how well stroke patients respond to hierarchical, multi-dimensional preventative cognitive training. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To describe the study design of this center implementation trial. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Participants in the study will be recruited from a hospital in China and randomly assigned to the intervention group or the usual care group. Interventions will include four-week hierarchical multi-dimensional preventive cognitive training through a WeChat program. for Primary outcome measures will be the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Post-Stroke Cognitive Impairment (PSCI) Incidence. The secondary outcome measure will include the Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Modified Barthel Index, and National Institutes of Health Neurological Deficit Score. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks from the baseline. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We expect that the hierarchical multi-dimensional preventive cognitive training program will be easy to implement, and the cognitive function, cognitive psychology, ability of daily living will vary in each setting. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results will provide evidence highlighting differences in a new strategy of cognitive training through the WeChat program, which allows the home-based practice, puts forward an advanced idea of preventive cognitive training in the acute stage, and has the highest effectiveness of reducing cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 - The authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has made it necessity that rehabilitation services are provided remotely to patients. These process required a transformation in healthcare. The aim of this study was investigate the effectiveness of the home-based online supervised exercise program in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the results of real-time supervised physical exercise telerehabilitation program in AD. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Eighteen subjects with early-middle stage of AD were randomised into 2 group as telerehabilitation group (TG; mean age: 77.7 +/- 5.29 years; 7 Female, 3 Male) and control group (CG; mean age: 78.5 +/- 7.07 years; 5 Female, 3 Male). Our primary outcome was Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), seconder outcomes were Timed Up&Go (TUG), One-leg Balance Test (OLBT), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS). The 6-week motor-cognitive dual-task exercise training was performed online and under the supervision of physiotherapist through videoconference. No physical or cognitive intervention was applied to the control group for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed before and after the treatment. In statistical analysis, the change in the outcome scores was calculated ( = last measurement-first measurement), the difference between the groups was performed with the Mann Whitney-U Test in SPSS 22.0. Trial's protocol is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov under number NCT04606251. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): There was a significant difference between TG and CG in favor of TG in MMSE, TUG, FIM and GDS (p<0,05); There was no significant difference between groups in OLBT (p>0,05). Statistical results have been showed in Table 1. No safety problem was observed during the treatment. All subjects were completed the study, there was a high adherence to treatment. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Physical exercise treatment with telerehabilitation was feasible, safe and well-accepted by people with early-middle stage of AD. Online-supervised exercise program can improve cognitive function, functional mobility, independence and reduce depressive symptoms.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 the Alzheimer's Association.

T1  - Relationship between grip strength and minimal clinically important differences in cognitive function in older adults with dementia in a long-term residential facility
A1  - Tanaka S.
A1  - Yamagami T.
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Objective. Non-pharmacological approaches effectively improve cognitive function in older adults with dementia in institutionalised settings. We aimed to investigate the physical characteristics of older adults with dementia achieving a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) following interventions for cognitive rehabilitation based on exercise. Methods. This retrospective analysis included 25 participants with dementia residing in a long-term care facility who underwent group exercise in a quasi-randomised controlled study. We calculated the MCID on the MMSE using a distribution-based method. The rounded values of the standard deviation (SD) of the MMSE at baseline of approxi-mately 0.4 and 0.5 were considered an MCID. Based on intervention outcomes, the participants were divided into MCID achievers and non-achievers. We compared changes in physical function based on grip strength, maximum knee extension strength, maximum 10-m gait time, and 5-m wheelchair driving time. Results. MCID achievers had significantly higher grip strength at baseline than non-achievers for both 0.4 x SD and 0.5 x SD. A multiple logistic regression analysis including age, sex, and MMSE at baseline revealed that grip strength was significantly associated with MCID achievement at 0.4 x SD (odds ratio [OR], 1.614; 95% confidence inter-val [CI], 1.04-2.51) and 0.5 x SD (OR, 1.585; 95% CI, 1.04-2.42). Conclusions. The importance of measuring grip strength was demon-strated by considering the achievement of an MCID for cognitive func-tion. Assessing objective changes using a distribution-based method may help evaluate rehabilitation outcomes. Higher grip strength at baseline was significantly associated with MCID improvement in the MMSE in institutionalised older adults with dementia.<ovid:br/>&#xa9; Copyright by Societa Italiana di Gerontologia e Geriatria (SIGG).

N2  - Background: Cognitive training is known to be effective in improving or preserving the cognitive functions of early-stage dementia patients. Robot PIO (Whydots Inc., South Korea) is a parrot-inspired interactive robot that can communicate with patients and offer an automated, personalized digital cognitive training program [1]. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the robot-based digital cognitive training program in improving dementia patients' cognitive performance. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This study compared the domain-specific cognitive performance of subjects before and after their participation in the robot-based cognitive training program. Thirty-six subjects with CDR 0.5 or 1 were enrolled through a public dementia center in Seoul, Korea, and twenty-seven subjects completed the robot PIO-based cognitive training program, which was conducted twice a week, 50 min/session, for six weeks [1]. Subjects' cognitive performances were evaluated at baseline and after completing the program with the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD-K) neuropsychological battery, which enabled comprehensive assessment of cognitive function through eight different neuropsychological tests (J1-J8) evaluating verbal fluency, naming, mental state, word recognition/memory/recall, and constructional praxis/recall [2]. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The mean age of the study population was 77.1 (SD 6.6) years, and 59.3% of the subjects were female. The average years of education was 6.4 (SD 4.5) years, and the average CDR at baseline was 0.69 (SD 0.25). After completing the robot-based cognitive training program, there was significant improvement in naming (J2 Boston Naming Test; before: 7.6 (SD 3.3), after: 8.3 (SD 3.5), p=0.01), Mini-Mental State Examination (J3; before: 20.1 (SD 4.5), after: 20.7 (SD 5.1), p=0.03), and word list recognition (J7; before: 5.9 (SD 3.1), after: 6.5 (SD 3.1), p=0.01). Other test scores were stable without significant change. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that the automated digital cognitive training program based on social robot PIO may improve or preserve the cognitive function of patients in the early stages of dementia. This implies a potential use of robots and related digital health technology to reduce the public health burden of dementia by assisting patient's cognitive training.

N2  - Background: In recent years, the effectiveness of multimodal intervention in dementia prevention has attracted attention, and several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, beginning with the FINGER study [1]. However, there is no consensus on the effectiveness of multidisciplinary interventions, and generalizing strategies to prevent cognitive impairment and dementia is challenging [2]. This study aims to conduct an RCT to examine the efficacy of a multi-domain dementia prevention program, which consists of lifestyle-related disease management, physical exercise, nutrition counseling, and cognitive training on improving or maintaining cognitive function or reducing cognitive decline in older people at risk for dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A randomized controlled trial (Japan-Multimodal Intervention Trial for Prevention of Dementia PRIME Tamba; J-MINT PRIME Tamba) was conducted to prevent cognitive decline in communitydwelling older people at risk of dementia [3]. Between Sep 2020, and Oct 2020, we screened 206 individuals and randomly assigned 203 participants (male: 57, mean age: 73.86+/-4.84, mean MMSE score: 28.65+/-1.36) were randomly assigned to the intervention group (101 participants) or the control group (102 participants). The intervention group received 90 minutes of group-based physical exercise weekly, cognitive training, nutritional counseling, and vascular risk factor management for 18 months (78 sessions total). The primary endpoint was the change in cognitive function from baseline to 18 months in a global composite score. The composite score was calculated by averaging the Z-scores of each neuropsychological test (i.e., MMSE, FCSRT, logical memory, digit span, DSST, TMT, and letter word fluency test). Statistical analyses were conducted using a linear mixed-effects model with a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <ovid:br/>Result(s): One hundred participants in the intervention group and 101 in the control group had baseline assessments and were included in the full analysis set. Twenty-six (12.8%) individuals dropped out overall. There was a statistically significant difference in the change in the cognitive composite score from baseline to 18 months, the primary endpoint (intervention group vs. control group; 0.54 +/- 0.41 vs. 0.39 +/- 0.41, p=0.020). In addition, for each domain of cognitive function, there were significant differences in executive functioning/processing speed (0.41 +/- 0.56 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.54, p=0.041). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study showed that an 18-month non-pharmacological multimodal intervention for communitydwelling older adults at risk of future dementia could improve cognitive composite score total scores, executive functioning, and processing speed.

N2  - Background: Cognitive intervention (CI) has been known to improve cognition and to delay cognitive decline in older adults. Although computerized cognitive interventions have been tried for older adults, sometimes it is noted that some older adults have difficulty adapting to computer-related new devices, which may further lead to lower compliance and adherence. The purpose of this study was whether semi-computerized cognitive training (CCT) for 12 weeks improved cognitive performance in older adults without dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Semi-CCT consists of a smart pad connected to a book. Various tasks or problems are presented on the smart pad, and patients can interact by touching the corresponding answers on the book. The smart pad records and displays the correctness of the response, indicating whether the answer is correct or not. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in 70 older adults without dementia. All participants underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and only those who scored above -1 SD compared to the norm were recruited for this study. Participants were randomized into the two groups: the CI with semi-CCT (CCT) (n=35) group and waitlist control group without cognitive intervention (Control) (n=35). The A total of 12 cognitive training programs provided to the participants targeting for attention, memory, visuospatial, calculation, language and frontal executive functions. The semi-CCT comprised 30-min-session per day for 12 weeks at home. The primary outcome was the changes of cognitive function measured using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were no baseline demographic and clinical differences between the CI and the control groups. Two participants from each group were dropped out. After 12 week intervention, semi-CCT group demonstrated improvement in memory and attention domain compared to the control group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that the 12 week home- based, semi-CCT could help improve cognitive function in older adults.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Current therapeutic evidence suggests limited efficacy of the cognitive and exercise training in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on depression, anxiety, memory retention, comprehension, calculation, concentration, orientation, dual-task performance, and sleep disorders. Nevertheless, the immediate effects of multimodal cognitive therapy (MCT) have recently developed and its individual effects remains unknown in MCI. <ovid:br/>OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to compare the immediate effects of MCT on cognitive and psychological measures between young healthy and older adults with MCI. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Forty young healthy and older adults with MCI underwent immediate MCT (5 minutes each), including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), light therapy, computerized cognitive therapy (CCT), robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT), core breathing exercises (CBE), and music therapy. Outcome measures included memory retention, comprehension, calculation, attention, orientation, dual-task performance, awareness, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. The Mann-Whitney U test and Friedman's test were used at P < 0.05. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Significant differences in depression, anxiety, memory retention, comprehension, calculation, attention, orientation, dual-task performance, and awareness were observed between the tDCS, CCT, and music therapy groups (P < 0.05). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): MCT was beneficial for mitigating depression, anxiety, memory retention, comprehension, calculation, attention, orientation, dual-task performance, and awareness.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 - IOS Press.

N2  - Introduction: Motor-cognitive interactive interventions, such as action observation training (AOT), have shown great potential in restoring cognitive function and motor behaviors. It is expected that an advanced AOT incorporating specific Tai Chi movements with continuous and spiral characteristics can facilitate the shift from automatic to intentional actions and thus enhance motor control ability for early-stage PD. Nonetheless, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The study aimed to investigate changes in brain functional connectivity (FC) and clinical improvement after 12 weeks of Tai Chi-based action observation training (TC-AOT) compared to traditional physical therapy (TPT). <ovid:br/>Method(s): Thirty early-stage PD patients were recruited and randomly assigned to the TC-AOT group (N = 15) or TPT group (N = 15). All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans before and after 12 weeks of training and clinical assessments. The FCs were evaluated by seed-based correlation analysis based on the default mode network (DMN). The rehabilitation effects of the two training methods were compared while the correlations between significant FC changes and clinical improvement were investigated. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The results showed that the TC-AOT group exhibited significantly increased FCs between the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and cerebellum crus I, between the posterior inferior parietal lobe and supramarginal gyrus, and between the temporal parietal junction and clusters of middle occipital gyrus and superior temporal. Moreover, these FC changes had a positive relationship with patients' improved motor and cognitive performance. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): The finding supported that the TC-AOT promotes early-stage PD rehabilitation outcomes by promoting brain neuroplasticity where the FCs involved in the integration of sensorimotor processing and motor learning were strengthened.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Meng, Wang, Shi, Li, Zhang, Lu, Zhu and Ming.

N2  - Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising treatment for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, identifying objective biomarkers that can predict brain stimulation efficacy, remains a challenge. The primary aim of this investigation is to delineate the cerebral regions implicated in AD, taking into account the existing lacuna in comprehension of these regions. In pursuit of this objective, we have employed a supervised machine learning algorithm to prognosticate the neurophysiological outcomes resultant from the confluence of tDCS therapy plus cognitive intervention within both the cohort of responders and non-responders to antecedent tDCS treatment, stratified on the basis of antecedent cognitive outcomes. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The data were obtained through an interventional trial. The study recorded high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) in 70 AD patients and analyzed spectral power density during a 6 min resting period with eyes open focusing on a fixed point. The cognitive response was assessed using the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. The training process was carried out through a Random Forest classifier, and the dataset was partitioned into K equally-partitioned subsamples. The model was iterated k times using K-1 subsamples as the training bench and the remaining subsample as validation data for testing the model. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A clinical discriminating EEG biomarkers (features) was found. The ML model identified four brain regions that best predict the response to tDCS associated with cognitive intervention in AD patients. These regions included the channels: FC1, F8, CP5, Oz, and F7. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that resting-state EEG features can provide valuable information on the likelihood of cognitive response to tDCS plus cognitive intervention in AD patients. The identified brain regions may serve as potential biomarkers for predicting treatment response and maybe guide a patient-centered strategy.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the feasibility and efficacy of short-term functional power training and further examine whether the addition of cognitive training targeting sustained attention and inhibitory control would augment the effect on the outcomes. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Randomized pilot study. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): Clinical research facility. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Community-dwelling primary care patients (N=25) aged >65 years with mobility limitation within the VA Boston Healthcare System. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): Participants were randomly assigned to either functional power training (n=14) or functional power+cognitive training (n=11), offered 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Session durations were either 70 minutes (functional power+cognitive training) or 40 minutes (functional power training). <ovid:br/>Main Outcome Measure(s): We evaluated feasibility (dropouts, attendance), mobility performance (Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB]), leg power [stair climb test]), dynamic balance [figure-of-8], and gait characteristics [gait speed, stance time, step width, swing time, step length, variabilities under single-task and dual-task conditions]). Nonparametric analyses were used to compare overall pre-post changes and between-group differences. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of the 39 veterans screened, 25 were randomized and enrolled. Twenty-one men with a mean age 76+/-7 years completed the study; 86% were white. Participants had a mean SPPB score of 8.3+/-1.6 out of 12. For those completing the study, overall attendance was 79%. Among all participants, clinically relevant and/or statistically significant median change in mobility performance (1 point), leg power (25.0W), dynamic balance (-1.1s), and gait characteristics (gait speed [0.08s, 0.09s], step length [1.9cm, 3.8cm], and stance time [-0.02s, -0.05s] under single- and dual-task, respectively) were observed after 6 weeks of training. There were no statistically significant group differences in dropouts, attendance rate, or any of the outcomes based on cognitive training status. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Short-term functional power training with or without a cognitive training led to clinically meaningful improvements in mobility performance, leg power, dynamic balance, and gait characteristics. These findings add to the body of evidence supporting the benefits of functional power training on clinically relevant outcomes. Additional cognitive training did not have an added effect on the study outcomes from our study. Further research is needed.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021

N2  - Introduction: Cognitive decline in the elderly population is a growing concern, and vascular factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and coronary heart disease, have been associated with cognitive impairments. This study aims to provide deeper insights into the structure of cognitive function networks under these different vascular factors and explore their potential associations with specific cognitive domains. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Cognitive function was assessed using a modified Chinese version of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scale, and intensity centrality and side weights were estimated by network modeling. The network structure of cognitive function was compared across subgroups by including vascular factors as subgroup variables while controlling for comorbidities and confounders. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The results revealed that cerebrovascular disease and coronary heart disease had a more significant impact on cognitive function. Cerebrovascular disease was associated with weaker centrality in memory and spatial orientation, and a sparser cognitive network structure. Coronary heart disease was associated with weaker centrality in memory, repetition, executive function, recall, attention, and calculation, as well as a sparser cognitive network structure. The NCT analyses further highlighted significant differences between the cerebrovascular disease and coronary heart disease groups compared to controls in terms of overall network structure and connection strength. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that specific cognitive domains may be more vulnerable to impairments in patients with cerebrovascular disease and coronary heart disease. These insights could be used to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of cognitive screening in these patient populations, inform personalized cognitive intervention strategies, and provide a better understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in patients with vascular diseases.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Wang, Zhang, Liu, Li, Zhou, Wei, Xu, Zhou and Tang.

N2  - Background: Maintaining cognitive and physical function is essential to healthy aging. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): This study aims to investigate the effect of an exercise-cognitive dual-task program in Chinese language on cognitive function and functional fitness in older adults. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Seventy adults aged 60-84 years were conveniently assigned to one of the three groups: exercise-cognitive dual-task (EC) group (n = 28), exercise group (n = 22), and control group (n = 20). The EC group received a 90-min class including multicomponent exercise-cognitive dual-task twice a week. The exercise group received a 90-min class including multicomponent exercise twice a week. The control group maintained their regular level of physical activity and general lifestyle. Cognitive functions and functional fitness were measured before and after the 12-week intervention. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The participants in the EC and exercise group significantly improved scores in Taiwanese Frontal Assessment Battery, the Chang Gung University Orthographical Fluency Test, and the Mini-Mental State Examination; however, those in the control group did not. The participants in the EC and exercise group showed significant increases in almost all functional fitness tests. The participants in the EC group showed significantly higher improvements in Chang Gung University Orthographical Fluency Test score and aerobic endurance than the exercise group and in Chang Gung University Orthographical Fluency Test score and lower body strength than the control group. In addition, the changes in Taiwanese Frontal Assessment Battery and Mini-Mental State Examination scores were significantly correlated with the changes in functional fitness. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The dual-task intervention resulted in greater improvements in verbal fluency, endurance, and muscular strength than exercise alone and control.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of music therapy (MT) and/or physical rehabilitation (PR) on cognitive and motor function in elderly Tunisian male and female patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Male patients (N: 16; age: 74.19 +/- 4.27 years; weight: 76.71 +/- 5.22 kg) and female patients (N: 12; age: 71.46 +/- 3.36 years; weight: 67.47 +/- 4.31 kg) with mild AD were randomly assigned into 4 groups including control group (Co), PR group participated in physical rehabilitation, MT group received music therapy and MT + PR received both music therapy and physical rehabilitation. Participants were required to engage in the study for four months with three 60-min sessions per week. We found all scores of cognitive (MMSE, ADAS-Cog Total and the ADAS-Cog Memory subscale) and motor functions (step length, walking speed, 6MVT and BBS score) evaluated were the greatest in MT + PR compared to the other groups. Our study also demonstrated that MT has a greater effect on cognitive function, while PR has a more pronounced effect on motor function. Changes in MMSE scores were significantly positively correlated in the PR, MT and MT + PR groups with improvements in all motor functions including step length (r = 0.77), walking speed (r = 0.73), 6MVT (r = 0.75) and BBS scores (r = 0.78) in AD patients. In conclusion, the combination of MT and PR seems to be an appropriate intervention approach that needs consideration as a treatment strategy for elderly male and female patients with mild AD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Cheour, Cheour, Gendreau, Bouazizi, Singh, Saeidi, Tao, Supriya, Bragazzi, Baker and Cheour.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is an emerging alternative intervention for stroke survivors. <ovid:br/>OBJECTIVE(S): This study investigated the effects of CCT on the cognition, activity, and participation of stroke survivors and compared the findings with those of match-dosed conventional cognitive training. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): This randomized controlled trial included 39 patients with stroke who were divided into the intervention group (n = 19; receiving CCT with Lumosity software) and the control group (n = 20; receiving conventional cognitive training). Both the groups were trained for 20 min, twice a week, for 12 weeks. Participants were evaluated at pretest, posttest, and 4-week follow-up. Outcome measures included various cognitive function tests and the Stroke Impact Scale scores. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The CCT group exhibited significant improvement in global cognitive function (evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and specific cognitive domains: verbal working memory (backward digit span test), processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities Test), and three MoCA subtests (attention, naming, and delayed recall). CCT exerted no significant effect on activities and participation. No significant between-group differences in changes in cognitive function were noted. However, CCT significantly improved cognitive function domains immediately after training, and these effects were sustained at the 4-week follow-up. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Cognitive function of individuals with chronic stroke could improve after administration of CCT. However, future studies with a more rigorous design and higher training dose are warranted to validate our findings.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: More than 80% of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop dementia (PD-D), a major predictor of both quality of life and mortality, within 20 years of diagnosis. Despite this, PD-D treatment is a major gap in the field. Cholinesterase inhibitors, the only option currently available, have limited efficacy and may worsen motor impairment. Alternative strategies to prevent development of cognitive impairment are needed. While cognitive training (CT) presents a promising option, motor impairments may limit accessibility, and hence efficacy, of tools typically used to deliver CT. Further, many CT studies fail to investigate either longterm benefits or transfer effects of training. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To address these gaps, we modified the highly accessible OrbIT gaming system, originally developed for children with cerebral palsy, to deliver targeted CT in PD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Twelve custom "Serious Games" were developed, with each designed to target the executive function deficits common in PD. Following game development, a group of community-dwelling individuals (n = 13; mean age = 68.15 years; mean disease duration = 8 years), all within normal bounds on the MMSE, participated in three reiterative co-design loops: an initial series of three 60-minute sessions where participants trialled the system and two 60-minute follow-up sessions, one- and six-months later, following system modifications. Following each loop, participants completed a series of feedback surveys and interviews. <ovid:br/>Result(s): During co-design, multiple outcomes, including enjoyment, accessibility, and usability of NeuroOrb, were evaluated. While initial impressions were positive, several key issues were identified. This led to major revisions of both the gaming suite and the system hardware. Following these changes, stakeholders rated changes to both the controller and the games extremely highly, and enjoyment and usability scores increased. A trial (n = 90 individuals; 30/group: NeuroOrb, "CogCafe" control group and normal activity control group) is currently underway to evaluate immediate and long-term benefits of NeuroOrb for cognition, as well as its effects on transfer to everyday ADLs and quality of life. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The engaging and targeted NeuroOrb system, optimised for use in PD through co-design with key stakeholders, may offer an exciting new option to deliver CT in individuals with PD.

N2  - Background: The risk of cognitive decline in older adults makes it necessary to design training programs for the improvement of cognition. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): To determine the efficacy of applying a combined program of computerized cognitive training (CCT) and mindfulness for improving cognition and mood and quality of life in people aged 60 years and older, compared with using both interventions separately. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Adults, older than 95 years were assigned to groups that subsequently received one of the three interventions (CCT, mindfulness, and combined). Cognitive, emotional, and quality of life assessment instruments were administered pre- and post-intervention. The standardized individual change was determined, and one-factor ANOVAs and ANCOVAs were conducted to test between-group differences. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After controlling for confounding factors, greater significant improvements were obtained in the combined group compared with the CCT and mindfulness groups in selective attention (median effect size) and abstract reasoning (large effect size). No significant differences were found in the rest of cognitive variables, mood or quality of life. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The findings indicate that, with the same investment of time, combining CCT and mindfulness effectively improves selective attention and abstract reasoning, in older adults. This combination of strategies might have implications for the improvement of cognitive impairment in older adults.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Previous studies set out profound cognitive impairments in subjects with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, little is known about the course of such alterations depending on levels of improvement in those patients followed longitudinally. The main objective of this study was to describe the course of cognitive impairments in responder versus non-responder TRD patients at one-year follow-up. The second aim was to evaluate the predictive aspect of cognitive impairments to treatment resistance in patients suffering from TRD. We included 131 patients from a longitudinal cohort (FACE-DR) of the French Network of Expert TRD Centers. They undertook comprehensive sociodemographic, clinical, global functioning, and neuropsychological testing (TMT, Baddeley task, verbal fluencies, WAIS-4 subtests, D2 and RLRI-16) at baseline (V0) and one-year follow-up (V1). Most patients (n = 83; 63.36%) did not respond (47 women, 49.47 +/- 12.64 years old), while one-third of patients responded (n = 48, 30 women, 54.06 +/- 12.03 years old). We compared the cognitive performances of participants to average theoretical performances in the general population. In addition, we compared the cognitive performances of patients between V1 and V0 and responder versus non-responder patients at V1. We observed cognitive impairments during the episode and after a therapeutic response. Overall, each of them tended to show an increase in their cognitive scores. Improvement was more prominent in responders at V1 compared to their non-responder counterparts. They experienced a more marked improvement in code, digit span, arithmetic, similarities, and D2 tasks. Patients suffering from TRD have significant cognitive impairments that persist but alleviate after therapeutic response. Cognitive remediation should be proposed after therapeutic response to improve efficiency and increase the daily functioning.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 by the authors.

N2  - Aim To investigate the effectiveness of a semantic-based memory-encoding strategy intervention and cognitive stimulation that enhances function for older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Methods A two-armed single-blind non-randomised cluster controlled trial was conducted. Participants in two centres were allocated to the semantic-based memory-encoding experimental group and those in the other two centres received cognitive stimulation. In both groups, one centre- or community-based session and one home-based session were provided weekly for 10 weeks. Outcome measures included attention, memory and general cognitive function (Word List Memory and Word List Recall of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for the Alzheimer's disease, Digit Span Forwards and Backwards and the Cognistat), and daily task performance (Disability Assessment for Dementia and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale). They were administered pre- and post-intervention. Results Thirty-nine participants completed the study. No significant differences were revealed in the demographic or baseline data. The experimental group showed significant improvements in daily task performance (Disability Assessment for Dementia; p = 0.003), memory outcomes (Word List Recall; p < 0.001), general cognitive function (Cognistat subtests of Memory and Similarity; ps = 0.002 and < 0.001). The cognitive stimulation control group did not show any significant improvement in the measures. Between-group analysis showed significant differences in favour of the experimental group for the outcome measures of the Word List Recall and Cognistat Similarity subtest (ps < 0.001). Conclusions This study shows that the semantic-based memory-encoding strategy is more superior than cognitive stimulation with improvements in attention, memory, general cognitive function and daily task performance for people with a mild cognitive impairment.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Mraz et al.

N2  - Background: The advances achieved by the available research that focus on understanding memory operation and cognitive functions have helped the development of specific treatment approaches. These can help to maintain or improve the cognitive function and well-being of people with dementia. The use of cognitive stimulation in dementia has a long history. There are multiple studies that have demonstrated its benefits on the cognitive levels of patients with mild to moderate dementia. However, all of the studies on this type of non-pharmacological intervention conclude that there is a need for more clinical trials in order to give more solidity to the evidence already found. The objective of this pilot study was to assess the effects of an occupational therapy cognitive training program on the cognitive function of institutionalized older adults with dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The study was a pilot randomized clinical controlled trial. A total of 58 participants with major neurocognitive disorder or dementia were randomized to the occupational therapy cognitive training program group or to the conventional occupational therapy group twice a week for 5 weeks. The cognitive level was measured with the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and the Lobo's Cognitive Mini Test (LCMT), which is the Mini-Mental Status Examination in Spanish. Measures were taken at baseline (week 0), after 5 weeks of treatment (week 5), and after 6 weeks of follow up (week 12). A value of p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were no statistical differences between groups in the LCMT global scores at baseline or after the intervention at week 5. However, the analysis of the specific cognitive areas assessed in the Lobo's Cognitive Mini Test indicated that that the intervention group significantly improved comprehension of verbal commands and praxis (p = 0.021). At the follow-up measure, the differences obtained in relation to verbal commands and praxis maintained the statistical differences significantly (p = 0.009). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Occupational therapy based on cognitive training shows positive effects on the maintenance of the global cognitive state of institutionalized older adults with dementia and improves significantly the comprehension of verbal commands and praxis.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Treatments that delay progression of cognitive impairment in older adults are of great public health significance. This manuscript outlines the protocol, recruitment, baseline characteristics, and retention for a randomized controlled trial of cognitive and aerobic physical training to improve cognition in individuals with subjective cognitive dysfunction, the "Cognitive and Aerobic Resilience for the Brain" (CARB) study. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Community-dwelling, older adults with self-reported memory loss were randomly assigned to receive either computer-based cognitive training, aerobic physical training, combined cognitive and physical training, or education control. Treatment was delivered 2- to 3-times per week in 45- to 90-min sessions for 12 weeks by trained facilitators videoconferencing into subject's home. Outcome assessments of were taken at the baseline, immediately following training, and 3-months after training. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 191 subjects were randomized into the trial (mean age, 75.5 years; 68% female; 20% non-white; mean education, 15.1 years; 30% with 1+ APOE e4 allele). The sample was generally obese, hypertensive, and many were diabetic, while cognition, self-reported mood, and activities of daily living were in the normal range. There was excellent retention throughout the trial. Interventions were completed at high rates, participants found the treatments acceptable and enjoyable, and outcome assessments were completed at high rates. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study was designed to determine the feasibility of recruiting, intervening, and documenting response to treatment in a population at risk for progressive cognitive decline. Older adults with self-reported memory loss were enrolled in high numbers and were well engaged with the intervention and outcome assessments.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Cognitive stimulation is essential for successful aging. The influence of sex and socio-occupational elements on this area remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the possible mediation of those elements in the effectiveness of a cognitive stimulation program in primary care. A randomized clinical trial was conducted with 232 adults aged 65 years or older without cognitive impairment. The intervention produced significant cognitive improvements. Women improved independently of social and occupational factors, while men's improvement occurred at a low role level (zero to one), a medium level of interests (two to three), with a medium level of mental occupation (neither high nor low), and with marked personal values. The mediating variables were the intervention group in both sexes and, also in men, a low and medium role level. Therefore, the intervention and roles appear as mediating variables moderated by sex. In conclusion, cognitive stimulation programs should be adapted.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Objective: To compare the effects of computerized cognitive training (CCT) and tai chi (TC) with usual care (UC) on cognitive functions and secondary outcomes in older adults with traumatic brain injury. Participants and Settings: Ninety-six patients aged 55 years and older who had a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury requiring hospital admission. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Randomized controlled trial. Main Measures: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS), Mini-Mental State Examination, modified Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status, and Trail Making Tests A and B. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Compared with UC, CCT increased scores on the MDRS's total, attention, and memory and those on the Mini-Mental State Examination and Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status over the 6-month intervention; TC increased scores on the MDRS's total and conceptualization and those on the Mini-Mental State Examination over the 6-month intervention, while it also increased scores on the MDRS's total and initiation/preservation and those on the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status and reduced the time to complete the Trail Making Test B over the 12-month study. Furthermore, compared with UC, CCT increased handgrip strength and TC reduced the time to complete 5 sit-to-stands over the 6-month intervention. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Both CCT and TC may improve global cognition and different specific cognitive domains in older traumatic brain injury patients; the TC's effect may last for at least an additional 6 months.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  - Background: Despite increasing interest in the effects of exergaming on cognitive function, little is known about its effects on older adults with dementia. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The purpose of this is to investigate the effects of exergaming on executive and physical functions in older adults with dementia compared to regular aerobic exercise. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In total, 24 older adults with moderate dementia participated in the study. Participants were randomized into either the exergame group (EXG, n=13, 54%) or the aerobic exercise group (AEG, n=11, 46%). For 12 weeks, EXG engaged in a running-based exergame and AEG performed a cycling exercise. At baseline and postintervention, participants underwent the Ericksen flanker test (accuracy % and response time [RT]) while recording event-related potentials (ERPs) that included the N2 and P3b potentials. Participants also underwent the senior fitness test (SFT) and the body composition test pre- and postintervention. Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to assess the effects of time (pre- vs postintervention), group (EXG vs AEG), and groupxtime interactions. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Compared to AEG, EXG demonstrated greater improvements in the SFT (F<ovid:inf>1.22</ovid:inf>=7.434, P=.01), reduction in body fat (F<ovid:inf>1.22</ovid:inf>=6.476, P=.02), and increase in skeletal mass (F<ovid:inf>1.22</ovid:inf>=4.525, P=.05), fat-free mass (F<ovid:inf>1.22</ovid:inf>=6.103, P=.02), and muscle mass (F<ovid:inf>1.22</ovid:inf>=6.636, P=.02). Although there was a significantly shorter RT in EXG postintervention (congruent P=.03, 95% CI 13.581-260.419, incongruent P=.04, 95% CI 14.621-408.917), no changes occurred in AEG. EXG also yielded a shorter N2 latency for central (Cz) cortices during both congruent conditions compared to AEG (F<ovid:inf>1.22</ovid:inf>=4.281, P=.05). Lastly, EXG presented a significantly increased P3b amplitude compared to AEG during the Ericksen flanker test (congruent: frontal [Fz] F<ovid:inf>1.22</ovid:inf>=6.546, P=.02; Cz F<ovid:inf>1.22</ovid:inf>=5.963, P=.23; parietal [Pz] F<ovid:inf>1.22</ovid:inf>=4.302, P=.05; incongruent: Fz F<ovid:inf>1.22</ovid:inf>=8.302, P=.01; Cz F<ovid:inf>1.22</ovid:inf>=15.199, P=.001; Pz F<ovid:inf>1.22</ovid:inf>=13.774, P=.001). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that exergaming may be associated with greater improvements in brain neuronal activity and enhanced executive function task performance than regular aerobic exercise. Exergaming characterized by both aerobic exercise and cognitive stimulation can be used as an effective intervention to improve cognitive and physical functions in older adults with dementia.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Shanshan Wu, Hongqing Ji, Junyeon Won, Eun-Ah Jo, Yun-Sik Kim, Jung-Jun Park.

N2  - Background: Obesity and estrogen deprivation are significant risk factors for dementia. Dietary intervention, a cornerstone of obesity management, has shown promising effects on improving cognitive function in obese individuals. A growing body of evidence has revealed that physical activity, particularly the combined physical-cognitive exercise, has beneficial effects on cognition, metabolic and cardiovascular profiles of adults with metabolic syndrome and postmenopausal women. Given the positive effects of both dietary and exercise interventions on cognition, it is posited that the combined intervention would provide greater benefits than each intervention alone. Therefore, the present randomized clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate the effects of combined physical-cognitive and dietary intervention on both cognitive function and circulating biomarkers of postmenopausal women with obesity. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A four-arm randomized controlled trial with blinded assessor will be conducted. Ninety-two participants with postmenopausal obese women will be randomly divided into one of four groups: dietary intervention group, physical-cognitive intervention group, physical-cognitive and dietary intervention group, or control group. Participants in the three intervention groups will receive a 12-week home-based program, while those in the control group will maintain and continue their caloric intake and usual activities. The main outcomes will be executive functions, episodic memory, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level. All outcomes will be assessed at pre-and post-12-week intervention. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): Research evidence has established the benefits of physical-cognitive training and dietary intervention on cognition. It is expected that the combined physical-cognitive and dietary intervention may further exhibit synergistic effects on cognition beyond the results of either physical-cognitive or dietary intervention alone.

N2  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a severe outcome after lung transplantation, especially in the elderly lung transplant recipients. Home-based computerized cognitive training (CCT) is a widely used intervention for cognition improvement, but its efficacy has not been validated in this population. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to analyze the effect of CCT on elderly lung transplant recipients. The participants received either an 8-week CCT intervention or usual care. The changes of cognitive function were assessed between preintervention (T1), postintervention (T2), and 12 weeks postintervention (T3). Among the 46 participants, 91.3% completed the interventions. The CCT group performed better than the control group on Digit-Span Forward Test (T3: p = 0.0044) and Verbal Fluency Test (T3: p = 0.0331), indicating the efficacy of CCT on verbal memory in the elderly lung transplant recipients. Although varied impacts were observed on different cognitive domains, it seems promising to use CCT on the elderly population after lung transplantation.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Background Computerized cognitive training programs may have benefited the self-assessment of memory, quality of life, and mood among older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Objective To determine the subjective impacts of computerized cognitive training on mood, frequency of forgetfulness, memory complaints, and quality of life in the elderly using an online platform. Methods In total, 66 elderly participants of USP 60 , a program for the elderly offered by Universidade de Sao Paulo, who voluntarily enrolled in the study were selected and randomized with an allocation ratio of 1:1 into 2 groups: the training group (n = 33) and the control group (n = 33). After signing the free and informed consent form, they answered a protocol which included a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Memory Complaints Questionnaire (MAC-Q), the McNair and Kahn's Frequency of Forgetfulness Scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI), and the Control, Autonomy, Self-Realization, and Pleasure (CASP-19) questionnaire. The training cognitive game platform aimed to stimulate various cognitive aspects, including memory, attention, language, executive functions (reasoning, logical thinking), and visual and spatial skills. Results The participants of the training group showed a reduction in the MAC-Q, MacNair and Kahn, and GAI scores in the pre- and posttest comparison. Significant differences were identified between the groups regarding the total scores of the MAC-Q in the post-test, which was also evidenced by the logistic regression. Conclusion Participation in a computerized cognitive intervention promoted reductions in memory complaints, frequency of forgetfulness, and anxiety symptoms, in addition to improving self-reported quality of life.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

N2  - Objective: There has been growing interest in the past few years on the relationship between impairment of motor functions and cognitive decline, so that the first can be considered a marker of dementia. In MCI patients, the deficit in processing visual information interferes with postural control, causing oscillations and instability. Postural control is usually evaluated through the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test or Tinetti scale, but, to our knowledge, there are no many studies that considered the Biodex Balance System (BBS) in the evaluation of postural controls in MCI patients. The aim of this study was first to confirm the bi- directional relationship between cognitive and motor performance, and then to compare traditional evaluation scales (SPPB and Tinetti) with a biomechanical tool, the BBS. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Observational retrospective study. In 45 elderly patients with cognitive impairment we evaluated cognition, assessed with the MMSE and MoCA, malnutrition with the MNA, and sarcopenia with DEXA (ASMMI). Motor performance was assessed with SPPB, Tinetti, and BBS. <ovid:br/>Result(s): MMSE correlated more with BBS than with the traditional scales, while MoCA was also correlated with SPPB and Tinetti scores. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): BBS had a stronger correlation with cognitive performance compared with the traditional scales. The relationship between MoCA executive items and the BBS tests suggests the usefulness of targeted interventions involving cognitive stimulation to improve motor performance, and motor training to slow the progression of cognitive decline, particularly in MCI.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Cognitive impairment is a very frequent and severe nonmotor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). Early intervention in this at-risk group for cognitive decline may be crucial for long-term preservation of cognitive functions. Computerized working memory training (WMT) has been proven beneficial in non-PD patient populations, but such evidence is still needed for patients with PD. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study aimed to evaluate the effect of WMT on visuo-spatial working memory (WM) in cognitively unimpaired patients with PD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A single-blind randomized controlled trial encompassing 76 patients with PD but no cognitive impairment according to level II diagnostic criteria was conducted. Thirty-seven patients engaged in home-based adaptive WMT 5 times per week for a period of 5 weeks, whereas the remaining patients were in the waiting list arm of the study (control group [CG]). Working memory performance was evaluated using a computerized task before and after intervention and at 14-week follow-up, allowing to quantify the precision of WM on a continuous scale, ie, to test not only if an item was remembered but also how well the location of this item was retained. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Coincidently, the WMT group showed slightly worse WM performance compared with the CG at baseline, which was ameliorated after WMT. This training-induced effect remained stable until follow-up. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Patients showing relatively low WM performance, despite not formally diagnosable as Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), seem to benefit from home-based WMT. Thus, WMT could potentially be implemented in future trials as a time- and cost-efficient route to counteract subtle cognitive changes in early disease stages.

N2  - Introduction: The impact of multi-domain preventive interventions on older adults, in particular on those with higher risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD), could be beneficial, as it may delay cognitive decline. However, the precise mechanism of such positive impact is not fully understood and may involve brain reserve and adaptability of brain functional connectivity (FC). <ovid:br/>Method(s): To determine the effect of multidomain interventions (involving physical activity, cognitive training, nutritional counseling alone or in combination with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and vs. a placebo) on the brain, longitudinal FC changes were assessed after 36 months of intervention on 100 older adults (above 70 year-old) with subjective cognitive complaints. <ovid:br/>Result(s): No global change in FC was detected after uni or multidomain preventive interventions. However, an effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation dependent on cognitive decline status was underlined for frontoparietal, salience, visual and sensorimotor networks FC. These findings were independent of the cortical thickness and vascular burden. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): These results emphasize the importance of patient stratification, based on risk factors, for preventive interventions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Perus, Mangin, Deverdun, Gutierrez, Gourieux, Fischer, Van Dokkum, Manesco, Busto, Guyonnet, Vellas, Gabelle, Le Bars and the MAPT/DSA group.

N2  - The term cognitive training includes a range of techniques that hold potential for treating cognitive impairment caused by neurologic injury and disease. Our central premise is that these techniques differ in their mechanisms of action and therefore engage distinct brain regions (or neural networks). We support this premise using data from a single-blind randomized-controlled trial in which patients with mild cognitive impairment were randomized to either mnemonic strategy training (MST) or spaced retrieval training (SRT) as they learned ecologically relevant object-location associations. Both training approaches were highly effective in the short term, but MST demonstrated a clear advantage after days to weeks. MST also increased activation in and functional connectivity between frontal, temporal, and parietal regions as well as the hippocampus. In contrast, patterns of reduced activation and functional connectivity were evident following SRT. These findings support the rational development of cognitive training techniques.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Authors.

N2  - Purpose of the research: Cognitive stimulation (CS) is defined as activities that involve cognitive processing, usually conducted in a social context and often in a group. This study aims to evaluate the effects of a personalized-adapted CS program in older adults on global cognition, neuropsychological constructs, activities of daily living (ADLs), and mood. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): The randomized controlled single-blind trial involving 337 participants (235 women and 102 men) >= 65 years of age in a Primary Care centre classified participants into 4 groups: 101 for the no deterioration (ND) group; 100 for the subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) group; 108 for the level deterioration (LD) group and 28 for the moderate deterioration group. The intervention consisted of a personalized CS adapted program for 10 weeks. Follow-up assessments were conducted post-intervention, and at 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome was global cognition measured by the Spanish version of the Mini-Mental State Examination. The secondary outcomes were measured by the Barthel Index, the Lawton and Brody Scale, the Goldberg Questionnaire (anxiety sub-scale) and the abbreviated Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The intervention showed a tendency of improvement on global cognition and different cognitive functions for groups with no deterioration or level deterioration. The group with moderate deterioration improved in anxiety. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The findings demonstrated benefits in global cognition, different cognitive functions, semantic fluency, IADLs and anxiety. The most benefits are given in the intermediate groups, SCI, and LD. Moreover, the intervention works by increasing the benefits in the different phases.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023

N2  - Aim: Previous studies have reported that computer-based cognitive training (CBCT) programs improve many cognitive functions, especially memory, attention, and executive functions in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In addition, these programs have been shown to improve patients' mood and quality of life. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effect of a CBCT program on cognitive functions, behavioral symptoms, and quality of life in early-stage AD patients. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-nine patients with a diagnosis of probable AD were included in the study. Patients and their caregivers were examined neuropsychologically before and after (after 12 weeks) the CBCT program. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), forward and backward digit span, clock drawing test (CDT), verbal fluency tests, and Trail Making Test A and B forms were used for cognitive assessment, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used for depression screening. In addition, patients and their caregivers were evaluated with the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale, the Caregiver Burden Scale, the Caregiver Stress Scale, and the Reactions to Helping Your Family Member Scale. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Forward and backward digit span tests at the end of the program were significantly better than those before the program (4.81 +/-0.75, p=0.01 / 10.72 +/-5.64, p=0.01, respectively). In addition, it was observed that the trail-making test form B was completed faster at the end of the program (308 +/-166.66 s, 200 +/-111.73 s; p=0.02). The reaction times of the patients at the end of the program were significantly shorter than those before (p=0.01). <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): The results indicate that the 12-week CBCT program provides an improvement in simple and sustained attention, delayed recall, executive functions, and information processing speed in early-stage Alzheimer patients. Large-scale randomized controlled studies are needed to more clearly demonstrate the effects of such programs on cognitive and behavioral symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver burden of AD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022, Derman Medical Publishing.

N2  - Age-related subjective memory complaints (SMC) are a common concern among older adults. However, little is known about the effects of cognitive stimulation (CS) interventions on subjective memory complaints. The aim of this study was to analyse the effectiveness of a CS programme on global cognition and cognitive functions of older adults with SMC. A randomised clinical trial was conducted on older adults with SMC, including 308 participants >=65 years of age assessed 6 and 12 months after the intervention. The assessment instrument was the Spanish version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MEC-35), and all domains of the instrument were assessed. For statistical analysis, the data were analysed using robust ANOVA with means truncated at 20% utilising a two-way repeated measures model, with between (groups) and within (measurements) factors. In post hoc tests, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test of exact permutations between groups and Bonferroni correction were applied. In post hoc between-group tests, significant differences were found: (1) post-treatment in MEC-35, temporal orientation, short-term memory (STM), global language and praxis, and language and praxis (p <= 0.005); (2) at 6 months in MEC-35, global orientation, temporal orientation, and STM (p = 0.005); (3) at 12 months in MEC-35, global orientation, temporal orientation, STM, global language and praxis, and language (p = 0.005). This study shows benefits in global cognition and orientation, temporal orientation, STM, and language in older adults with SMC.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 by the authors.

N2  - Objective: Identification of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) with cognitive impairment is important for patient management (medical treatment, cognitive rehabilitation and social arrangements). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is currently recommended over the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) by the US National Institute of Neurological Disorder, in the chronic post-stroke setting. We hypothesised that the MoCA has a better correlation with functional outcome at 3 months than the MMSE. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We carried out a prospective observational study in Hong Kong over a 2 year period, recruiting patients aged 21-75 years with aSAH admitted within 96 h of ictus. The assessments included the modified Rankin Scale, Lawton Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL), Short Form-36, MoCA and MMSE at 3 months after ictus. Analyses were carried out to compare MoCA with MMSE. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 90 patients completed the 3 month assessments. Cognitive impairment (MoCA <26) was determined in 73% of patients at 3 months. Delayed cerebral infarction explained the 31-38% variance in cognitive outcomes (MMSE and MoCA) at 3 months. MoCA demonstrated good discrimination of favourable neurological and IADL outcomes similar to the MMSE in receiver operating characteristics curve analyses. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): MoCA defined cognitive impairment was common at 3 months after aSAH and MoCA correlated with functional outcomes similar, but not superior, to the MMSE. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov of the US National Institutes of Health (NCT01038193).

N2  - Background and purpose: Hypoperfusion of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus has consistently been reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with cognitive training (COG) is effective in alleviating the symptoms of patients with mild AD. This study investigated the effects of rTMS-COG therapy on cerebral blood flow (CBF), with a special interest in the PCC/precuneus, and whether observed CBF changes are associated with changes in neuropsychological assessments in AD. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-one patients with mild or moderate AD were randomly divided into real rTMS (n = 11) and sham treatment (n = 10) groups, both combined with COG. Neuro-navigated 10 Hz rTMS was used to stimulate the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and then the left lateral temporal lobe (LTL) for 20 min each day for 4 weeks in the real rTMS group. All patients with AD underwent neuropsychological assessment, pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling, and structural 3D T1-weighted MRI before treatment (T0), immediately after treatment (T1), and 4 weeks after treatment (T2). CBF in the precuneus, PCC, and stimulation targets at the region-of-interest (ROI) level, as well as whole-brain CBF changes at the voxel level, were compared between the two groups at three timepoints. <ovid:br/>Result(s): rTMS-COG therapy revealed significant group x time interactions for the Mini-Mental State Examination (F = 5.339, p = 0.023, eta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.433) and activities of daily living (F = 5.409, p = 0.039, eta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.436) scores. The regional CBF in the precuneus showed a significant group x time interaction (F = 5.833, p = 0.027, eta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.593). For voxel-level analysis, a significant group main effect was found in the left limbic lobe cluster, with the maximal peak in the left parahippocampus (p < 0.001, uncorrected, peak at [-16 -8 -24]). Simple effects analysis indicated that rTMS-COG therapy induced a decrease in CBF in the precuneus at T1 (p = 0.007) and an increase in the left parahippocampus at T2 (p=0.008). CBF decrease in the precuneus was correlated with better cognitive function immediately after treatment (T1) (r =-0.732, p=0.025). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Neuropsychological assessments showed immediate and long-term effects on cognitive function and activities of daily living after rTMS-COG therapy. CBF changes induced by high-frequency rTMS-COG therapy are region-dependent, showing immediate effects in the precuneus and long-term effects in the left parahippocampus. These results provide imaging evidence to understand the underlying neurobiological mechanism for the application of rTMS-COG in AD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Qin, Ba, Zhang, Jian, Zhang and Zhu.

N2  - Depression and cognition are associated, but the role of depressive symptoms in lifestyle interventions to prevent dementia needs further study. We investigated the intervention effect on depressive symptoms and their associations with cognition in the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER; NCT01041989), a two-year multidomain lifestyle trial. One thousand two-hundred and sixty individuals (60-77 years) at risk for dementia were randomised into a multidomain intervention (diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular/metabolic risk monitoring) or control group (regular health advice). Depressive symptoms (Zung scale) and cognition (modified Neuropsychological Test Battery) were evaluated at baseline, 12, and 24 months. One thousand one-hundred and twenty-five participants had baseline Zung data. Mean Zung score decreased 0.73 (SD 5.6) points in the intervention and 0.36 (5.6) points in the control group, with nonsignificant between-group difference (group x time coefficient -0.006, 95% CI -0.019 to 0.007). Overall, higher baseline Zung score was associated with less improvement in global cognition (-0.140, p = 0.005) and memory (-0.231, p = 0.005). Participants with clinically significant baseline depressive symptoms (Zung >= 40 points) had less intervention benefit to executive functioning (group x time x Zung -0.096, 95% CI -0.163 to -0.028). Change in Zung score was not associated with change in cognition. Clinically significant depressive symptoms warrant more attention when designing dementia-prevention interventions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Background: Computer-based programs have been implemented from a psychosocial approach for the care of people with dementia (PwD). However, several factors may determine adherence of older PwD to this type of treatment. The aim of this paper was to identify the so-ciodemographic, cognitive, psychological, and physical-health determinants that helped predict adherence or not to a "GRADIOR" computerized cognitive training (CCT) program in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This study was part of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) (ISRCTN: 15742788). However, this study will only focus on the experimental group (n = 43) included in the RCT. This group was divided into adherent people (compliance: >=60% of the sessions and persistence in treatment up to 4 months) and non-adherent. The participants were 60-90 age and diagnosed with MCI and mild dementia. We selected from the evaluation protocol for the RCT, tests that evaluated cognitive aspects (memory and executive functioning), psychological and physical health. The CCT with GRADIOR consisted of attending 2-3 weekly sessions for 4 months with a duration of 30 min Data analysis: Phi and Biserial-point correlations, a multiple logical regression analysis was obtained to find the adherence model and U Mann-Whitney was used. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The adherence model was made up of the Digit Symbol and Arithmetic of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) and Lexical Verbal Fluency (LVF)-R tests. This model had 90% sensitivity, 50% specificity and 75% precision. The goodness-of-fit p-value of the model was 0.02. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): good executive functioning in attention, working memory (WM), phonological verbal fluency and cognitive flexibility predicted a greater probability that a person would be adherent.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Cognitive training has been shown to improve cognitive functions in healthy older adults. However, little is known about which specific variables are responsible for the improvement. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): Our aim was to evaluate whether healthy older adults benefit more from a structured cognitive training program than an unstructured brain jogging program and to identify possible predictors for training success, including apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4). <ovid:br/>Method(s): In a randomized controlled trial, participants completed either a 6-week structured cognitive training program (n=35) or a 6-week unstructured brain jogging program (n=35). A control group received no training and was not part of the randomization procedure (n=35). Overall, 105 participants were included in the training data analyses, focusing on verbal memory, attention, and executive functions. Data from an additional 45 previously trained, healthy older adults were used for the predictor analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A significant TimexTraining interaction in favor of the structured cognitive training program was found in verbal memory. Low baseline performance on neuropsychological tests was a significant predictor for benefits in verbal memory, attention, and executive functions. A subgroup analysis (n=35) revealed that only noncarriers of the apoE4 allele showed significant gains in long-term verbal memory and attention. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results support the greater effectiveness of structured cognitive training on verbal memory compared with brain jogging and no training. The success of this type of training program may be predicted by sociodemographic, cognitive, and genetic variables.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Female sex, subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) are known risk factors for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously demonstrated that yoga improved depression, resilience, memory and executive functions, increased hippocampal choline concentrations, and modulated brain connectivity in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): In this study (NCT03503669), we investigated brain gray matter volume (GMV) changes in older women with SCD and CVRFs following three months of yoga compared to memory enhancement training (MET). <ovid:br/>Method(s): Eleven women (mean age = 61.45, SD = 6.58) with CVRF and SCD completed twelve weeks of Kundalini Yoga and Kirtan Kriya (KY + KK) while eleven women (mean age = 64.55, SD = 6.41) underwent MET. Anxiety, resilience, stress, and depression were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks, as were T1-weighted MRI scans (Siemens 3T Prisma scanner). We used Freesurfer 6.0 and tested group differences in GMV change, applying Monte-Carlo simulations with alpha = 0.05. Region-of-interest analysis was performed for hippocampus and amygdala. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Compared to KY + KK, MET showed reductions in GMV in left prefrontal, pre- and post-central, supramarginal, superior temporal and pericalcarine cortices, right paracentral, postcentral, superior and inferior parietal cortices, the banks of the superior temporal sulcus, and the pars opercularis. Right hippocampal volume increased after yoga but did not survive corrections. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Yoga training may offer neuroprotective effects compared to MET in preventing neurodegenerative changes and cognitive decline, even over short time intervals. Future analyses will address changes in functional connectivity in both groups.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 - The authors. Published by IOS Press.

N2  - Background: At least 40% of dementia cases worldwide might be attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors. In Latin America (LA), 56% of dementia cases are attributable to these risk factors. Thus, interventions on these risk factors can significantly benefit dementia prevention in LA. LatAm-FINGERS is the first non-pharmacological multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) to prevent cognitive impairment in LA. It gathers 12 countries, including the Spanish-and Portuguese-speaking populations. The project is harmonized with both the original Finnish trial for the prevention of cognitive decline (FINGER) (Kivipelto et al., 2020) and the study to Protect Brain Health through a Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk (U.S. POINTER). However, LA is a heterogeneous region with ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity. Thus, a harmonization process within LA, considering the cross-cultural variability of neuropsychological tests, was necessary to adapt eligibility criteria, outcomes, and interventions. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To investigate the feasibility of a multi-domain lifestyle intervention in LA and the efficacy of the intervention in improving cognitive function in 1200 participants (100 per country) within two years. We aim to present the study design and discuss strategies used for multicultural harmonization. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The study design included an external harmonization process carried out to follow the original FINGER model and an internal harmonization to make this study feasible and comparable across the 12 countries. A workgroup of experts representing all the consortium countries was assembled. The aim of the inclusion criteria harmonization was to achieve a homogenous selection of participants in all countries. For that purpose, we compared normative values in neuropsychological tests across LA, considering different levels of education and age. Regarding outcomes, harmonization included using shared cognitive protocols for each variable. This task required comparing versions and arriving at a harmonized version in Spanish and Portuguese for each test and measure. Finally, regarding interventions, working groups (WG) of experts with at least one expert from each country were convened. WG included nutrition, physical activity, cognitive intervention, health monitoring, biobank, and neuroimaging subgroups. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Inclusion criteria harmonization was achieved using each country's normative z-scores. Educational level and age from each region were included to make the assessment fit regional standards. Barriers to these processes included the absence of normative data for many countries regarding commonly used cognitive tests, such as the MMSE and CERAD. Outcome harmonization resulted in a Latin American Neuropsychological Test Battery (LatAm NTB). Finally, the intervention harmonization included local perspectives from participating countries, looking for feasibility and adherence. Interventions were adapted to have a common core but flexibility to allow local idiosyncrasies. LatAm-FINGERS recruitment started on December 2021, and up to date, 986 participants were screened, and 731 were randomized to the interventions. Regarding the sample's demographic characteristics, we must highlight the overrepresentation of women (from 60% in Peru to 89% in Colombia). The mean age is 67.8 (+/-4.8) years, the level of education is 12.4 years (+/-4.8), and the MMSE scores 27.3 (+/-1.7). The diversity of the population is reflected in self-reported ethnicity: 56% of the participants self-reported being Mestizo, and 35% as Caucasian. Other reported ethnicities included Mulatto (2.1%), African-American (1.9%), and Asian (0.7%). The preliminary recruitment results show a significant opportunity for improvement in cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors: 10% are current smokers, 42% have high systolic blood pressure (>130mmHg), 20% have blood diastolic pressure over (>85mmHg), 81% of participants were overweight (BMI >=25 kg/m2), 42% had low HDL (<40 mg/dL in men or 50 mg/dL in women), 37% had hypertriglyceridemia(fasting triglyceride >150mg/dL), and 63% of had central obesity (waist circumference over 88 cm for women or 102 cm for men), 32% have abnormal fasting glucose (>100mg/dL), which indicate a metabolic syndrome prevalence of 38% in our sample. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This is the first non-pharmacological lifestyle intervention trial to prevent cognitive decline, including participants from 12 LA countries. LatAm-FINGERS faces a significant challenge in combining the region's diversity into a single healthy lifestyle intervention feasible across LA. This report presents the results of the effort achieved by effective multicultural teamwork. Furthermore, LatAm-FINGERS is building the largest data set on people at risk of dementia in LA. With longitudinal follow-up, it has already grown to be the region's largest cognitive, imaging, biomarker, and genetic database of individuals at risk for dementia. LatAm-FINGERS aspires to be the foundation stone of dementia teamwork in LA, confirming the potential value of collaboration in the region.

N2  - Background: Multidomain interventions may have a beneficial effect on cognitive function, especially in at risk populations, but their effects on alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker trajectories have not yet been well studied. Previously, expensive and/or burdensome procedures were required to measure AD biomarkers but reliable blood-based assays have recently been developed. Like CSF p-tau, and in contrast to PET tau biomarkers, plasma p-tau is known to be elevated in early stages of AD, and fluid tau biomarkers have been suggested to be preferential for monitoring intervention effects in clinical trials. Although CSF p-tau may be a closer indicator of brain processes than peripheral measures, plasma biomarkers offer huge advantages in the clinical trial setting in terms of cost and burden, thus enabling their measurement in larger numbers of participants. To our knowledge, plasma p-tau181 has not yet been evaluated in a multidomain prevention trial setting. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): Our objectives were to (1) assess the effects of a multidomain intervention, omega-3 supplementation, and both interventions combined, compared to placebo, on 3-year change in plasma p-tau 181; and (2) assess intervention effects on 3-year change in a composite cognitive score (the MAPT primary outcome) in participants with abnormal baseline p-tau181. <ovid:br/>Method(s): MAPT was a 3-year randomized controlled prevention trial involving 1680 community-dwelling individuals aged 70 and older with memory complaints, a limitation in one instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) and/or slow walking speed (>= 0.8 m/s). Participants also had to be free of dementia at baseline, with a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score >=24, and have no difficulties in basic ADL. Participants were randomized into 4 groups, receiving a multidomain lifestyle intervention (group-based cognitive training, advice and education (including personalized action plans) on physical activity and nutrition, and an annual preventive consultation), omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, both interventions combined, or placebo for 3-years. The trial's primary outcome measure was a composite cognitive score calculated as the average of z-scores for the following tests: MMSE orientation items, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (sum of free and total recall scores), category fluency and Digit Symbol Substitution Test. For the present analysis, we included a subsample of participants (n=527) with plasma p-tau 181 measured in stored blood samples taken at baseline and 3-years. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In the total sample, median (IQR) p-tau181 concentrations were similar at baseline and 3 years. Baseline p-tau181 was significantly higher in older participants (median [IQR] p-tau181 (pg/ml): 11.6 [10.4-21.9] in participants aged 85 and older; 10.1 [7.9-13.0] for age 80-84y; 9.0 [7.0-12.5] for age 75-79y; 8.3 [6.2-11.2] for age 70-74y; p<0.001), men (10.0 [7.5-12.6] versus 8.4 [6.5-11.5]; p=0.001), APOE4 carriers (9.8 [7.5-12.5] versus 8.4 [6.6-11.8]; p=0.039), those with renal dysfunction (10.1 [7.4-12.8] versus 8.6 [6.6-11.6]; p=0.039), and those with a positive PET amyloid scan (11.0 [7.7-13.0] versus 7.9 [6.0-10.9]; p<0.001), but did not differ by baseline CDR score or BMI. Amongst the 505 participants with p-tau181 data at both baseline and 3-years, there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between randomization groups. Preliminary analyses suggested no significant change in p-tau181 between baseline and 3-year follow-up in any of the groups, and no significant between-group difference in change. Between-group differences in cognitive change by baseline p-tau status will be presented. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In our prevention trial setting, expected associations were found between plasma measures of p-tau 181 and socio-demographic, clinical, and biological characteristics. Preliminary analyses suggested no change in p-tau181 over time, and no between-group differences in change. Full results will be presented and implications for future trials will be discussed.

N2  - Introduction: Considering increasing occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders in older adults, such as alzheimer's disease (AD), and in the absence of effective drug treatment, cognitive training appears to be a promising alternative for improving cognitive functioning and daily living. The efficacy of cognitive training in patients with AD is still under the debate regarding the best methodological approaches to optimize the training outcomes, commitment, and motivation. The computer-based cognitive training (CBCT) provides wide variety of well-calibrated exercises easily adaptative to each patient. The short-and long-term benefits of CBCT first shown in healthy older adults have also been proven in patients with AD and MCI. Overall, studies recommend early intervention with 30 minutes to 1 hour sessionseveral times a week. Such recommendations are hard to apply as most people will only consult when symptoms become more pronounced and high-frequency cognitive training protocols require frequent travels between home and speech-language pathologists- (SLP) offices. The patients- compromised autonomy . and many health problems are additional difficulties leading to training interruptions. One way of circumventing these problems is to design remote CBCT sessions. Our main hypothesis is that remote CBCT is an effective way to increase the cognitive and psychological benefitsthrough increased frequency of training. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The aim of this study was to examine short-and long-term benefits of CBCT at home in patients with mild to moderate AD, as a complement to the training in SLP's offices. The secondary purpose was to study training frequency required to obtain noticeable effects. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): The study followed a conventional protocol used to evaluate cognitive and psychological benefits of CBCT. A multicenter study was conducted in SLP's offices. Because of COVID pandemic, only a limited number of patients have been included. Twelve women and 12 men (n=24) diagnosed with AD according to DSM-V criteria (MMSE mean = 26.25; SD = 3.06) were included for 8-month duration protocol. They gave their informed consent to participation to this study, which obtained the authorization of the national ethical committee CPP Sud Mediterranee III (Nr. 2019-A00458-49) and was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04010175). Patients received CBCT for 4 months under one of three conditions: (1) in SLP's office once a week (REG-regular group), (2) in SLP's office once a week plus once at home (MFG-moderate frequency group), and (3) in SLP's office once a week plus three times at home (HFG-high frequency group). The trainings- content in SLP office and at home were identical. Eight SLP's offices (inclusion centres) were pseudo-randomly assigned into training frequency groups. During the CBCT patients performed a series of short exercises targeting memory, executive functions, processing speed, visuospatial abilities for 45 minutes using the Happyneuron Professional software ( https://www.happyneuronpro.com ). To test the training's effect, three types of instruments were used: experimental tasks, neuropsychological tests, and questionnaires. The primary measures were patients- scores in executive and working memory experimental tasks. The secondary were patients- scores in neuropsychological tests and questionnaires. These measures were performed at 3-point: T1 (pre-training), T2 (post-training) and T3 (3-month posttraining). Because the inclusion of expected number of patients per group was not possible due to the pandemic COVID-19 the innovative statistical approach was used to analyse the data. Sequence analyzes (Abbott & Tsay, 2000) was performed based on an event: the number of exercises carried out and of a state (scores obtained each time) to identify typical trajectories, these trajectories were then compared to the three groups and with well-being scores. We used R software with TramMineR. Depending on the exercises type (executive or working memory) between two and three typical trajectories came out. In a case of two trajectories, one has shown an absence of progress and the second a progression. In the case of three trajectories, one has shown an absence of progress, one a slight progress and another one a real progress. For well-being, three trajectories were observed: one without progression, another with a small progression and comprising undulations (progression, regression, progression) and a third where the progression was more important and more linear. The pre-post-training comparisons have shown significantly more important improvement in working memory and executive functions (inhibition) in HFG group than two other groups. This study shows the progression with training and some of the benefits of training on cognition and well-being in patients with alzheimer's disease.The main limitation of the study is a small number of patients included to the study due to the health crisis. However, this work opens a new way to identify parameters for optimizing the CBCT (selection of exercises, adaptation of difficulty levels and frequency of training).

N2  - The Japan-Multimodal Intervention Trial for Prevention of Dementia PRIME Tamba (J-MINT PRIME Tamba) is a randomised controlled trial to prevent cognitive decline in community-dwelling cognitively ordinary older people at risk of dementia. Participants are aged 65-85 years living in a rural area in Japan, aware of very mild decline in cognitive function or abilities of activities of daily living, have at least one vascular risk (e.g. hypertension or diabetes), and have a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24 or higher. Approximately 200 participants are randomly divided into two groups, with the intervention group receiving a multi-modal intervention, including lifestyle-related disease management, physical exercise, cognitive training, and nutritional counselling, over 18 months. The primary outcome is change in the composite score of seven neuropsychological tests, including the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Logical Memory I and II subsets of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. In addition, changes in a wide range of other parameters such as physical function, blood test results, sleep, and frailty are also analysed as secondary outcomes. We believe that this study's results will contribute significantly to the development of dementia prevention measures in Japan.

N2  - Developing support and an environment for patients with dementia in hospitals is impor-tant. This study aims to assess the immediate effect of one-session cognitive stimulation intervention on the mood of patients with dementia in a hospital as preliminary evidence. This study included 33 female patients. The cognitive stimulation intervention was conducted in the day room of the hospital ward by two occupational therapists. The patients participated in one or more sessions. The cognitive stimulation intervention was designed to discuss current affairs that implicitly stimulate memory, executive function, and language skills, according to the cognitive stimulation definition. Outcomes were evaluated using a two-dimensional mood scale. The primary outcome was pleasure. The before and after session scores for the first session and the average score before and after each session at multiple times were compared. The patients' pleasure showed significant improvements in both analyses. These results may indicate that one-session Cognitive stimulation intervention in a hospital effectively improves a mood of pleasure immediately. This study is the first report to provide preliminary evidence on the beneficial alterations of mood after one-session cognitive stimulation intervention for patients with dementia in hospitals. Cognitive stimulation intervention may be an effective non-pharmacotherapy for these patients.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - We investigated the effectiveness of virtual-reality-based cognitive training (VRCT) and exercise on the brain, cognitive, physical and activity of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). <ovid:br/>Method(s): This study included 99 participants (70.8 +/- 5.4) with MCI in the VRCT, exercise, and control groups. The VRCT consisted of a series of games targeting different brain functions such as executive function, memory, and attention. Twenty-four sessions of VRCT (three days/week) were performed, and each session was 100 min long. Exercise intervention consisted of aerobic and resistance trainings performed in 24 sessions for 60 min (2 times/week for 12 weeks). Global cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) of the neural oscillatory activity in different frequency bands was performed. Physical function was measured using handgrip strength (HGS) and gait speed. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After the intervention period, VRCT significantly improved the MMSE scores (p < 0.05), and the exercise group had significantly improved HGS and MMSE scores (p < 0.05) compared to baseline. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of resting-state EEG showed a decreased theta/beta power ratio (TBR) (p < 0.05) in the central region of the brain in the exercise group compared to the control group. Although not statistically significant, the VRCT group also showed a decreased TBR compared to the control group. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test showed a significant decrease in theta band power in the VRCT group compared to the exercise group and a decrease in delta/alpha ratio in the exercise group compared to the VRCT group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that VRCT and exercise training enhances brain, cognitive, and physical health in older adults with MCI. Further studies with a larger population sample to identify the effect of VRCT in combination with exercise training are required to yield peak benefits for patients with MCI.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 by the authors.

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediary state between normal aging and dementia. Early intervention for MCI may be a key opportunity in managing dementia. Recent studies have demonstrated the alterations in the gut microbial communities associated with MCI. This study aims to evaluate if acupuncture can improve cognitive function in subjects with MCI and explore the possible mechanism of acupuncture by better defining the interactions of gut microbiota. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A randomized assessor-blind controlled study is proposed. A total of 62 subjects will be recruited and randomly allocated into two groups in a 1:1 ratio: the treatment and control groups. Participants in the treatment group will receive active acupuncture and exercise/cognitive training (conventional treatment). The control group will receive sham acupuncture and exercise/cognitive training. Each participant will receive active or sham acupuncture for 12 weeks. The primary outcome will be the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score and intestinal flora. Secondary outcomes will include mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and activity of daily living (ADL) scores. Various scales will be collected at baseline, during the treatment (weeks 4 and 8), week 12, and months 4 and 6 after the intervention. Feces will be collected before and after the treatment based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology for each participant to characterize the intestinal flora. Adverse events will be recorded by monthly follow-up. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The trial is expected to show that cognitive function can be improved by acupuncture and produce reliable clinical outcomes in MCI patients. It will also provide preliminary data on the possible mechanism based on the changes in the intestinal flora. Collected data will be used to support future large-scale fundamental studies. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Acupuncture is an effective method to improve cognitive function for MCI. This study will provide data on the relationship between gut microbiota and the effectiveness of acupuncture in patients with MCI from a new angle.

N2  - The cognitive stimulation induced by multilingualism may slow down age-related memory impairment. However, a suitable neuroscientific framework to assess the influence of multilingualism on age-related memory processes is missing. We propose an experimental paradigm that assesses the effects of semantic congruency on episodic memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To this end, we modified the picture-word interference (PWI) task to be suitable for the assessment of older multilingual subjects undergoing fMRI. In particular, stimulus materials were prepared in multiple languages (French, German, Luxembourgish, English) and closely matched in semantic properties, thus enabling participants to perform the experiment in a language of their choice. This paradigm was validated in a group (n = 62) of healthy, older participants (over 64 years) who were multilingual, all practicing three or more languages. Consistent with the engagement of semantic congruency processes, we found that the encoding and recognition of semantically related vs. unrelated picture-word pairs evoked robust differences in behavior and the neural activity of parietal-temporal networks. These effects were negligibly modulated by the language used to perform the task. Based on this validation in a multilingual population, we conclude that the proposed paradigm will allow future studies to evaluate whether multilingualism aptitude engages neural systems in a manner that protects long-term memory from aging-related decline.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Perquin, Viswanathan, Vaillant, Risius, Huiart, Schmit, Diederich, Fink and Kukolja.

N2  - Background: Little is known regarding the dose-response function in multidomain interventions for dementia prevention. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial is a 3-year randomized controlled trial comprising cognitive training, physical activity, nutrition, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for at-risk older adults. The dose delivered (number of sessions attended) was modeled against global cognition, memory, and fluency in 749 participants. Interaction effects were assessed for age, sex, education, dementia score (CAIDE), frailty score, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 status. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The dose-response models were non-linear functions indicating benefits up to about 12 to 14 training hours or 15 to 20 multidomain sessions followed by a plateau. Participants who benefited from a higher dose included women, younger participants, frail individuals, and those with lower education or lower risk of dementia. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): The non-linear function indicates that a higher dose is not necessarily better in multidomain interventions. The optimal dose was about half of the potentially available sessions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Authors.

N2  - Background: Cognitive stimulation is one of the non-pharmacological therapies recommended for intervention in dementia, consisting of activities involving different cognitive domains and involving brain activation. New technologies can be very useful in this field, favoring intervention tasks. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The objective of this work is to test the effectiveness of a cognitive stimulation intervention mediated with new technologies on a group of people with moderate dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This is a quantitative, quasi-experimental study with a control and treatment group, with three measurement times (pre, post, and follow-up months after the end of the intervention). Ninety-eight subjects with moderate dementia were randomly assigned to the treatment group (N = 50) and the control group (N = 48). The treatment group received 16 intervention sessions including attention, executive function, and memory tasks, which were presented using new technologies and the activity was conducted in a group setting. Control group remained on a waiting list. The evaluators did not know which group each subject belonged to. All participants were assessed with a battery of neuropsychological tests. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The results show an improvement in post-intervention outcomes in the treatment group compared to the control group on cognitive variables. No differences were found in mood depression. These results fade overtime after a few months without intervention. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This type of intervention is useful to maintain cognitive functioning using new technologies and in a group setting, which favors the intervention. The improvements of the intervention disappear at follow-up, which would indicate the need to maintain the intervention over time.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) and its preclinical stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), are critical issues confronting the aging society. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have the potential to be effective tools for enhancing cognitive functioning. The main objective of our meta-analysis was to quantify and update the status of the efficacy of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) when applied in AD and MCI. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science according to PRISMA statement. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g) from 32 studies were analyzed using random effect models. We found both, rTMS and tDCS to have significant immediate cognition-enhancing effect in AD with rTMS inducing also beneficial long-term effects. We found no evidence for synergistic effect of cognitive training with NIBS. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In AD a clinical recommendation can be made for NEURO-AD<ovid:sup>TM</ovid:sup> system and for high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as probably effective protocols (B-level of evidence) and for anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC as a possibly effective. <ovid:br/>Significance: According to scientific literature, NIBS may be an effective method for improving cognition in AD and possibly in MCI.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology

N2  - Objectives To investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile model of environmental enrichment (EE), a paradigm that promotes activity engagement after stroke, in patients with mixed medical conditions receiving inpatient rehabilitation. Design A mixed methods study design was used. An online qualitative survey assessed staff perspectives of acceptability of the mobile EE model including perceived barriers and enablers pre-implementation and post implementation. An A-B quasi-experimental case study of patient activity levels over a 2-week observational period provided feasibility data. This included recruitment and retention rates, completion of scheduled patient activity observations and validated baseline questionnaires, and number of adverse events. Setting A 30-bed mixed medical ward in a public hospital that services Brisbane's southern bayside suburbs. The rehabilitation programme operates with patients co-located throughout the medical/surgical wards. Participants Nursing and allied health professionals working across the rehabilitation programme completed pre-implementation (n=19) and post implementation (n=16) qualitative questions. Patients admitted to the ward and who received the inpatient rehabilitation programme from June to November 2016 were also recruited. Interventions The mobile EE intervention included activities to primarily promote social and cognitive stimulation (eg, puzzles, board games) delivered by hospital volunteers and was designed to be moved throughout the wards. Results Four themes emerged from staff reports, suggesting that the role of patient, staff and intervention characteristics, and the ward environment were important barriers and enablers to implementation. Of the 12 eligible patients, six consented to the study, and five completed the intervention. All patients completed the baseline measures. No adverse events were reported. Conclusions As interest grows in human EE models, it will be important to tailor EE interventions to the unique demands of hospital rehabilitation services. A mobile EE model delivered in a small, mixed rehabilitation ward appears feasible and acceptable to study in a larger controlled feasibility trial.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9;

N2  - Background: The efficacy of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with cognitive training in the treatment of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) requires further investigation. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We randomly assigned 60 patients with PSCI to receive iTBS (n = 21), tDCS (n = 19), or cognitive training alone (n = 20). Cognitive function was evaluated by the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA), and the performance of activities of daily living (ADL) was assessed with the modified Barthel Index (MBI). Of these patients, 14 participated in the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measurement. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After six weeks of treatment, cognitive function improved in all three groups of PSCI patients. Compared with patients receiving only cognitive training, the cognitive function of patients in the iTBS combined with cognitive training (p = 0.003) and tDCS combined with cognitive training groups (p = 0.006) showed greater improvement. The cognitive improvement from tDCS was related to the activation of the frontopolar cortex (FPC), while the improvement of cognition by iTBS was based on the activation of the stimulation site (the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and some distant regions. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Both iTBS and tDCS in addition to cognitive training appear to improve cognitive function and quality of life of patients with PSCI, compared to cognitive training alone. tDCS improved cognitive function by improving the patient's valuation, motivation, and decision-making substructures, while iTBS improved patients' assessment and decision-making abilities, improving cognitive control and, ultimately, overall cognitive function.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Author(s).

N2  - Introduction: Cognitive dysfunction reduces patients' quality of life and social participation with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Computerized cognitive rehabilitation is increasingly being used for cognitive therapy in TBI patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of age on the effect of computerized cognitive rehabilitation in cognitive dysfunction after TBI. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 34 patients with cognitive dysfunction after TBI were enrolled. Participants performed 30 sessions of computerized cognitive rehabilitation (Comcog) for 6 weeks. A cognitive evaluation was performed before and after treatment with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Computerized Neurophyschologic Test (CNT). <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were no cognitive tests that differed between the young group and the old group at baseline. However, after computerized cognitive rehabilitation, the young group showed significant improvement compared to the old group in verbal memory, visual memory, attention, and visuo-motor coordination tests. The young group showed improvement in MMSE, verbal and visual memory, and visuo-motor coordination tests after computerized cognitive rehabilitation. In contrast, the old group showed significant improvement only in MMSE and visual learning test, one of the visual memory tests. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate that age may be an important factor related to the effect of computer cognitive rehabilitation on cognitive dysfunction after TBI. Methodologically more ordered studies with larger sample sizes are needed in the future.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

T1  - Effects of Spatial Cognitive Training Using Virtual Reality on Hippocampal Functions and Prefrontal Cortex Activity in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment
A1  - Park J.-H.
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background: The effects of spatial cognitive training on hippocampal functions and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are unclear yet. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of spatial cognitive training using virtual reality (VR) on hippocampal function and PFC activity in older adults with MCI. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Fifty older adults with MCI were randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG) performing spatial cognitive training using VR or the control group (CG) receiving computerized spatial cognitive training for a total of 24 sessions. To confirm the effects of spatial cognitive training using VR, the Weschsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Block Design Test (WAIS-BDT) and the Seoul Verbal Learning Test (SVLT) were performed and oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) was measured using a functional infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After 24 sessions, the EG showed significantly greater improvements in WAIS-BDT scores (p < .001, h<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = .495), the SVLT scores (p < .05, h<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = .110), and HbO2 values (p < .05; c<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.244), compared to the CG. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Spatial cognitive training using VR could be clinically effective for improving hippocampal functions and PFC activity in older adults with MCI.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022, Taiwan Society of Geriatric Emergency & Critical Care Medicine.

N2  - Background: With the aging of the population, the number of people with age-related memory complaints has also increased. The purpose of this study was to develop a cognitive rehabilitation program based on mnemonic skills and memory compensatory strategies (CRM) and to investigate the effects of CRM in community-dwelling older adults without dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This study was an open-label, single-arm, pilot study. We developed a CRM program comprising 8 weekly sessions. The study participants consisted of older adults with normal cognitive function and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). They were recruited from eight dementia counseling centers and one senior welfare center. To assess the effects of CRM, we administered the following tests at baseline and after completion of the program: Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire, the Short form of Geriatric Depression Scale, the Euro Quality of life-5 Dimension, and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Neuropsychological Assessment Battery. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Thirty-two participants completed the study. Among older adults with normal cognitive function, CRM showed significant improvement in verbal memory function. Among the older adults with MCI, CRM showed significant improvements in language ability, verbal recognition memory, nonverbal memory, attention, and processing speed. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): CRM improved cognitive function in two distinct populations, older adults with normal cognitive function and older adults with MCI. Additionally, our preliminary findings suggest that older adults with MCI show cognitive improvement in both the trained and non-trained cognitive domains.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 the Author(s).

METHODS This pilot study was conducted in patients with early AD treated in the Geriatric Department of the Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital between August 2019 and March 2021. The patients were divided into a cognitive training group and a conventional nursing group using the random number table method. Patients in the conventional nursing group received conventional nursing, whereas the patients in the cognitive training group received the new nursing intervention. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and activities of daily living (ADL) scales were used to compare the cognitive ability and daily activities, respectively, between the two groups before and after the intervention. RESULTS Sixty patients were enrolled in this study, with 30 patients in the cognitive training group and conventional nursing group, respectively. The MMSE and ADL scores were significantly higher in the cognitive training group than in the conventional nursing group after the intervention (MMSE: 25.11 +/- 2.02 vs 22.26 +/- 1. 23, P = 0.032; ADL: 68.72 +/- 4.86 vs 60.16 +/- 2.27, P = 0.018). CONCLUSION The application of cognitive training in clinical nursing for patients with early AD could improve both their cognitive ability and ADL. This method could be applied in clinical practice to manage cognitive dysfunction in patients with early AD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - Objectives: To investigate the clinical efficacy of integrated multidomain intervention among community-living older adults with multimorbidity and physio-cognitive decline syndrome (PCDS). Design, Setting and Participants: This is the secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial that data of 340 participants with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores>=18 were excerpted for analysis. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): Sixteen 2-hour sessions per year were provided for participants, including physical exercise, cognitive training, dietician education and individualized integrated care for multimorbidity. Measurements: Handgrip strength, 6-m walking speed, MoCA (total score and sub-domains), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) frailty score, quality of life, and serum biochemistry biomarkers. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Overall, 96/340 (28.2%) of all participants have PCDS, and the integrated multidomain intervention significantly improved global cognitive performance (overall difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.4-1.8, p=0.003), and domains of concentration (overall difference 0.3, 95%CI 0.1-0.5, p=0.011), language (overall difference 0.2, 95%CI 0.1-0.3, p=0.006), abstract thinking (overall difference 0.1, 95%CI 0.0-0.3, p=0.027), and orientation(overall difference 0.2, 95%CI 0.0-0.4, p=0.013) across all timepoints among those with PCDS. Besides, interventions also significantly reduced frailty score among those with cognitive impairment no dementia (overall difference -0.3, 95%CI -0.5 - -0.1, p=0.011) and mobility impairment no disability (overall difference -0.3, 95%CI -0.4 - -0.1, p=0.004). and improved quality of life at domain of physical role limitation among those with PCDS (overall difference 5.3, 95%CI 0.3-10.4, p=0.038). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The integrated multidomain lifestyle intervention plus multimorbidity management significantly improved cognitive function, and enhanced quality of life among older adults with multimorbidity and PCDS in the communities.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022, Serdi and Springer-Verlag International SAS, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Introduction: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by cognitive deficits, loss of daily functions, and mental and behavioral disorders, which cause stress and negatively affect the quality of life. Studies in the field suggest that combining cognitive training with physical activity can reduce the risk of developing the disease and, once neurodegeneration has begun, it slows its progress. In particular, virtual reality and augmented reality administer cognitive stimulation while providing a link to autobiographical memory through reminiscence, enabling the improvement of the person's quality of life. The present protocol aims to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive and physical treatments, integrated with the addition of virtual reality and reminiscence elements, using the Brainer software, in which people will find cognitive training, and the jDome<ovid:sup></ovid:sup> BikeAroundTM system, which will allow participants to pedal along a personalized path projected on a schematic, using an exercise bike connected to the system. Methods and analysis: For this study, 78 patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia were recruited and divided into the Experimental Group (EG) and Control Group (CG). Sixteen treatment sessions of 60 min each were conducted for both groups (2 training sessions per week, for 8 weeks), including 1 patient at a time. The EG received cognitive treatment with Brainer and physical training with jDome, while the CG received cognitive treatment with Brainer and physical training with a classic bicycle. The evaluation mainly focused on the assessment of the person's cognitive status. Other analyses were conducted on the quality of life, mood, behavioral disorders, and physical function, which were considered secondary outcomes. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): The ultimate goal of the present study is to test the effectiveness of a treatment for people with mild Alzheimer's focused on the integration of cognitive training and aerobic physical activity, using an exercise bike, with the addition of virtual reality and reminiscence elements. Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the IRCCS INRCA. It was recorded in ClinicalTrials.gov on 2 June 2022 with the number NCT05402423. The study findings will be used for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presentations in scientific meetings.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Gambella, Margaritini, Benadduci, Rossi, D'Ascoli, Riccardi, Pasquini, Civerchia, Pelliccioni, Bevilacqua and Maranesi.

N2  - Background: Recent studies have reported that sulforaphane (SFN) intake with cognitive training had positive effects on cognitive functions. However, it is still unknown whether SFN intake alone has beneficial effects on cognition as well as mood. We investigated whether a SFN intake intervention improved cognitive performance and mood states in healthy older adults. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In a 12-week, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT), we randomly assigned 144 older adults to a SFN group or a placebo group. We asked the participants to take a supplement (SFN or placebo) for 12 weeks. We measured several cognitive functions, mood states, and biomarkers before and after the intervention period. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The SFN group showed improvement in processing speed and a decrease in negative mood compared to the placebo group. In addition, the SFN group exhibited a higher SFN-N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) level compared to the placebo group. However, there were no significant results in other biomarkers of oxidant stress, inflammation, or neural plasticity. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): These results indicate that nutrition interventions using SFN can have positive effects on cognitive functioning and mood in healthy older adults.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Nouchi, Hu, Ushida, Suganuma and Kawashima.

N2  - (1) Background: Mild cognitive impairment is becoming one of the most common clinical manifestations affecting older people. For this reason, developing non-pharmacological strategies to help improve or maintain the physical condition of patients with mild dementia has become a priority. Therefore, the objective of this study is to provide evidence about the effects of a cognitive stimulation program on cognitive performance, anxiety, depression, and quality of life in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and aged > 70. (2) Methods: This study is a randomized clinical trial. A total of 72 elderly people with MCI participated: 35 in the control group who did not receive any intervention and 36 in the experimental group who received a cognitive stimulation program for 12 weeks. Cognitive performance, depression, anxiety and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale, and the SF-12, respectively. (3) Results: In the experimental group, significant results were obtained on cognitive performance, depression, anxiety and general health, emotional role, social functioning, vitality, mental health and mental component summary domains of the SF-12. (4) <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): a cognitive stimulation program of 12 weeks improves cognitive performance, anxiety, depression, and HRQoL in people with MCI aged > 70.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Objectives: Cognitive training is one of the management options for elderly individuals who suffer from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and an effective way to improve executive function. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a magic intervention program as a method of cognitive training in improving cognitive function and neurocognitive performance in this group. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Twenty-four participants aged 60-80 years with MCI were recruited and randomly assigned to a magic intervention group or a control group. The magic intervention group received a 6-week magic intervention program. The primary endpoints were the scores for the cognitive assessment tests [e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)] for general cognitive function. The secondary endpoints were the behavioral [e.g., accuracy and reaction times] and the electroencephalographic [e.g., event-related potential (ERP) P3 amplitudes] performance during the Flanker task to assess attention and inhibitory control. All variables were measured before and after the magic intervention. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The results showed that the 6-week magic intervention significantly improved the MoCA scores in the cognitive assessment tests although no significant pre-post intervention difference was observed in the MMSE scores. In terms of neurocognitive performance, the magic intervention had significantly positive effects on the accuracy, reaction times, and P3 amplitudes when performing the Flanker task. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results of the present study showed that the 6-week magic intervention had beneficial effects on the cognitive and electrophysiological performance in the elderly subjects with MCI. For such a group, lifestyle intervention programs that encourage participation such as the magic practice and performance may be a viable suggestion to prevent the progression of MCI to Alzheimer's disease.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Lee, Wang, Lin, Yang and Tsai.

N2  - Background: Computer-based cognitive training programs have been developed with promising results on the maintenance/improvement of cognitive performance in people with dementia. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the cognitive rehabilitation program 'GRADIOR' in people with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This study was a single-blind multicenter randomized clinical trial. Participants were recruited from hospitals/day centers. The experimental group (EG) and control group (CG) received computer-based cognitive training (CCT) and routine daily care, respectively. Outcome measures at T0: baseline, T1: at 4 months, T2: at 12 months were compared within and between-groups. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Significant differences or important effect sizes were detected at the intragroup and intergroup level for most variables, observing a trend of improvement and/or maintenance at 4 months by Visual Reasoning of Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG), Digit and Arithmetic of WAIS-III, Semantic Verbal Fluency, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Trail Making Test (TMT)-A-Mistakes and at 12 months by Visual Reasoning of CAMCOG, Digit Symbol of WAIS-III, TMT-B-mistakes, Visual Memory of Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, Lexical Verbal Fluency-P, Yesavage's Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), TMT-A-time scales whose objective was to evaluate some executive functions and/or the memory. The CG presented a worsening trend for most of the measures towards 12 months. There was also a significant interaction between 'time and group' for MMSE (F = 8.971; p = 0.03; eta2 = 0.019) and the GDS (F = 3.414; p = 0.04; eta2 = 0.041), as well as small effect sizes for TMT-A-time (F = 1.641; p = 0.21; eta2 = 0.021) and TMT-A-mistakes (F = 0.908; p = 0.41; eta2 = 0.019). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): CCT with GRADIOR has been proved to benefit cognitive functions (ISRCTN:15742788).<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 - The authors.

N2  - Background: Cognitive interventions (CIs) in the elderly are activities that seek to improve cognitive performance and delay its deterioration. Our objectives were to study potential genetic predictors of how a CI program may influence immediate and delayed episodic verbal memory (EVM). <ovid:br/>Method(s): 162 participants were elderly individuals without dementia who were randomized into parallel control and experimental groups. Participants underwent genetic testing to analyze the PICALM, ACT, NRG1, BDNF and APOE genes. We performed a broad neuropsychological assessment before and 6 months after the CI. The CI involved multifactorial training (30 sessions). The control group undertook the centre's standard activities. The main outcome measures were the genotype studied as a predictor of post-intervention changes in EVM. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We found the CI was associated with improvements in several cognitive functions, including immediate and delayed EVM. While no individual gene was associated with any such change, the interaction between PICALM/ACT (p = 0.008 Eta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.23) and PICALM/NRG1 (p = 0.029 Eta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.19) was associated with improved immediate EVM, and the NRG1/BDNF interaction was associated with improved delayed EVM (p = 0.009 Eta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.21). The APOEepsilon4 genotype was not associated with any change in EVM. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our study shows that the participants' genotype can have an impact on the results of CIs. Cognitive stress may stimulate the interaction of various genes and as such, different types of CI should be established for distinct groups of people taking into account the individual's characteristics, like genotype, to improve the results of this type of health prevention and promotion activity.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Author(s).

N2  - Cognitive stimulation is one of the non-pharmacological therapies recommended for dementia intervention. The present study evaluated the efficacy of an intervention based on cognitive stimulation in people with moderate Alzheimer's disease. Fifty-nine subjects with moderate dementia were randomly assigned to the stimulation group (N = 36) and the control group (N = 35). The treatment group received 16 intervention sessions cognitive tasks. All participants were evaluated with a battery of neuropsychological tests at three time points (pre, post, and follow-up). The treatment group showed significant increases in the three domains studied (memory, attention, and executive functions), although some of these effects were not maintained at follow-up. The control group progressively worsened. Cognitive stimulation was found to be an effective intervention for people with moderate Alzheimer's disease because it helped to maintain memory function, executive functions, and attention. However, the effects were minimized at the 3-month follow-up.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - Aim. The study evaluated the efficacy of computer-aided cognitive training program on cognitive measures, behavioral and depressive symptoms in persons suffering from Major Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder (vNCD). Methods. Retrospective study on a panel of 55 subjects with vNCD divided into a treatment group (n. 31) and a control group (n. 24) evaluated at baseline (T0) and at endpoint (T1) at 24 weeks. All subjects received the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montgomery and Aasberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-P). The treatment group underwent a 24 weeks of computer-aided cognitive training. Results. Significant better performances of the treatment group were recorded at T1on MMSE. A significant reduction of behavioral disorders was shown by the treatment group as compared to the control group. No effect was observed on depression. Conclusions. Computer aided cognitive training showed positive effects on both behavioral and cognitive dimensions in persons suffering from vNCD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; by Societa Italiana di Gerontologia e Geriatria (SIGG).

N2  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of metacognitive training (MCT) on improving the neurocognitive function of Chinese patients with schizophrenia. One hundred inpatients with schizophrenia were selected by regional group randomization and divided into the control (treated as usual, TAU) group (n = 50) and the TAU + MCT group (n = 50). In this study, a 10-module MCT was used and the intervention process lasted 30 days. Cognitive function was assessed blindly using the Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) scale at baseline, 24 h post-treatment, and 12 weeks' post-treatment. The differences between the total RBANS score and baseline (pre-test) for the post-test and 12-week-follow-up tests were used as the primary outcome, and the difference between the RBANS dimension scores and baseline (pre-test) were used as a secondary outcome in this study. The completion rate at follow-up was high in the TAU + MCT group (94%). Intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis showed a significant increase in total neurocognitive function scores and three-dimensional scores (delayed memory, visual breadth, and attention) in the TAU + MCT group immediately after the intervention and at the 12-week follow-up compared with baseline. This study provides support for the efficacy of 10 module MCT concerning neurocognition.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - As an intermediate state between normal aging and dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), especially amnestic MCI (aMCI), is a key stage in the prevention and intervention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether dancing could increase the hippocampal volume of seniors with aMCI remains debatable. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of aerobic dance on hippocampal volume and cognition after 3 months of aerobic dance in older adults with aMCI. In this randomized controlled trial, 68 elderly people with aMCI were randomized to either the aerobic dance group or the control group using a 1:1 allocation ratio. Ultimately, 62 of 68 participants completed this study, and the MRI data of 54 participants were included. A specially designed aerobic dance routine was performed by the dance group three times per week for 3 months, and all participants received monthly healthcare education after inclusion. MRI with a 3.0T MRI scanner and cognitive assessments were performed before and after intervention. High-resolution three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired for the analysis of hippocampal volume. A total of 35 participants (mean age: 71.51 +/- 6.62 years) were randomized into the aerobic dance group and 33 participants (mean age: 69.82 +/- 7.74 years) into the control group. A multiple linear regression model was used to detect the association between intervention and the difference of hippocampal volumes as well as the change of cognitive scores at baseline and after 3 months. The intervention group showed greater right hippocampal volume (beta [95% CI]: 0.379 [0.117, 0.488], p = 0.002) and total hippocampal volume (beta [95% CI]: 0.344 [0.082, 0.446], p = 0.005) compared to the control group. No significant association of age or gender was found with unilateral or global hippocampal volume. There was a correlation between episodic memory and intervention, as the intervention group showed a higher Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory (WMS-RLM) score (beta [95% CI]: 0.326 [1.005, 6.773], p = 0.009). Furthermore, an increase in age may cause a decrease in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (beta [95% CI]: -0.366 [-0.151, -0.034], p = 0.002). In conclusion, 3 months of aerobic dance could increase the right and total hippocampal volumes and improve episodic memory in elderly persons with aMCI. Clinical Trial Registration: This study was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry [www.chictr.org.cn], identifier [ChiCTR-INR-15007420].<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Zhu, Gao, Guo, Qi, Xiao, Wu, Ma, Zhong, Ding, Zhou, Ali, Zhou, Zhang, Wu, Wang, Sun, Thabane, Zhang and Wang.

N2  - Objective: To investigate whether transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) could improve post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) and the potential mechanisms through which this can be achieved. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Sixty patients with PSCI were selected and randomly divided into a control and observation group, respectively, with 30 cases in each group. Conventional cognitive rehabilitation training combined with TUS intervention was conducted in the observation group, while conventional cognitive rehabilitation training and sham-TUS stimulation were given to patients in the control group. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The Mini-Mental State Exam, Modified Barthel Index score, P300 latency, and wave amplitude, as well as the serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, were significantly higher in both groups after treatment compared with those before treatment (P < 0.05), and were significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (P < 0.05). After treatment, the observation group had significantly higher scores in executive, nomination, attention, language, and delayed recall compared with the control group (P < 0.05). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Transcranial ultrasound stimulation combined with conventional cognitive rehabilitation therapy improved the PSCI condition with better efficacy than conventional cognitive rehabilitation therapy only. The mechanism involved may be correlated with the upregulation of BDNF and P300 induced by TUS.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022, Fondazione Societa Italiana di Neurologia.

N2  - Purpose: Major neurocognitive disorders (MND) have multiple negative consequences on patients' lives and on their caregivers' health. Occupational therapy and cognitive stimulation have failed to show any significant efficacy on quality of life (QoL), cognitive functioning and behavioural symptoms. Bretonneau Hospital's Day Care Unit offers personalized and structured multi-domain interventions to cognitively impaired older patients on a weekly basis, for a 3-month period. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): Our objective was to determine whether a specific rehabilitation day care unit (RDCU) could influence the QoL of cognitively impaired community-dwelling elderly patients. We also aimed to better understand the characteristics of patients who had the most benefited from the RDCU. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Retrospective study based on a sample of outpatients participating in RDCU during three months. All patients underwent a cognitive (MMS), functional (IADl, ADL) and behavioral (NPI) assessment. We compared QoL using the QoL-Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) scale before and after RDCU. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Overall, we included 60 outpatients in our study (mean age 83.3 +/- 5.8; women = 70%). We found a statistically significant improvement of QoL-AD scores after RDCU (31.8 +/- 4.9 to 32.9 +/- 5.2, P = 0.008). Patients who benefitted the most from RDCU were older (P = 0.01) and had lower baseline QoL (P = 0.04). We did not find any other characteristics associated with QoL-AD score improvement in our population. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): RDCU showed positive effects on QoL in this uncontrolled pilot study of older adults with MND. These findings should be confirmed in a future randomized controlled trial to corroborate the potential benefits of RDCU on QoL in older cognitively impaired patients.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical syndrome of mild memory or other cognitive impairment without dementia and is a clinical transition state between normal aging and dementia. Careful and meticulous nursing intervention can improve the clinical symptoms of MCI and delay the progression of the disease. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): This research aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive function training interventions in elderly patients with MCI. <ovid:br/>Method(s): 106 patients were randomized into the intervention group or the control group. They received conventional nursing intervention and those in the intervention group received additional cognitive training program for 6 weeks. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), activities of daily living (ADL) scales, and Barthel index (BI) were evaluated before and 6 weeks after the intervention, as well as the serum levels of S100beta and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) at two time points. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After intervention, the MMSE scores and MoCA scores in both groups were significantly increased and the score in the intervention group was significantly higher. In the intervention group, the performance of conventional nursing intervention and cognitive training program significantly increased the scores of ADL and BI (p < 0.001). The serum levels of NSE and S100beta in the intervention group were significantly lower. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): The performance of cognitive training program alleviated the brain tissue damage in elderly patients with MCI. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The performance of cognitive training program in elderly patients with MCI improved their cognitive ability and daily living ability.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - Objective: Computerized cognitive training has been successful in healthy older adults, but its efficacy has been mixed in patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). <ovid:br/>Method(s): In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel clinical trial, we examined the short- and long-term efficacy of a brain-plasticity computerized cognitive training in 113 participants with amnestic MCI. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Immediately after 40-hours of training, participants in the active control group who played computer games performed better than those in the experimental group on the primary cognitive outcome (p = 0.02), which was an auditory memory/attention composite score. There were no group differences on 2 secondary outcomes (global cognitive composite and rating of daily functioning). After 1 year, there was no difference between the 2 groups on primary or secondary outcomes. No adverse events were noted. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Although the experimental cognitive training program did not improve outcomes in those with MCI, the short-term effects of the control group should not be dismissed, which may alter treatment recommendations for these patients.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - This pilot study aimed to investigate the initial effect of a remotely delivered performancebased client-centered intervention on activity performance and participation among adults in the chronic phase after acquired brain injury (ABI). Sixteen participants living at home with little to no assistance in basic daily activities were allocated into intervention or waitlist control groups. Assessments were conducted at the baseline, after the 3-month intervention/wait period, and at a 3- month follow-up. The primary outcomes were activity performance using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the Performance Quality Rating Scale (PQRS) and participation using the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4). The intervention included weekly videoconferencing sessions using the Cognitive Orientation to Daily Occupational Performance approach (tele-CO-OP). The participants identified five functional goals, of which three were directly addressed. Wilcoxon signed-ranks test results showed no significant improvements in the control group at the end of the 3-month wait period. Pooled data from both groups showed significant improvements in COPM scores for trained and untrained goals following the intervention. Significant improvements were also found in the PQRS and MPAI-4 scores. Improvements were partially maintained at follow-up. Our preliminary results suggest that tele-CO-OP may positively impact the lives of adults after ABI who are coping with long-term disability.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Objective: To compare the clinical effects of interactive dynamic scalp acupuncture (IDSA), simple combination therapy (SCT), and traditional scalp acupuncture (TSA) on cognitive function, depression and anxiety in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A total of 660 patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment who were admitted to 3 hospitals in Shenzhen City between May 2017 and May 2020 were recruited and randomly assigned to the IDSA (218 cases), SCT (222 cases) and TSA groups (220 cases) according to a random number table. All the patients received conventional drug therapy for cerebral stroke and exercise rehabilitation training. Scalp acupuncture and computer-based cognitive training (CBCT) were performed simultaneously in the IDSA group, but separately in the morning and in the afternoon in the SCT group. The patients in the TSA group underwent scalp acupuncture only. The course of treatment was 8 weeks. Before treatment (M0), 1 (M1) and 2 months (M2) after treatment, as well as follow-up at 1 (M3) and 2 months (M4), the cognitive function of patients was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) Scales; depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and self-care ability of patients were assessed using Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Modified Barthel Index (MBI), respectively. During this trial, all adverse events (AEs) were accurately recorded. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were no significant differences in the MMSE, MoCA, HAMD, HAMA, PSQI, and MBI scores among the 3 groups at M0 (all P>0.05). In the IDSA group, the MMSE, MoCA and MBI scores from M2 to M4 were significantly higher than those in the SCT and TSA groups, while the HAMD, HAMA and PSQI scores were significantly reduced (all P<0.01). The changes of all above scores (M2-M0, M4-M0) were significantly superior to those in the SCT and TSA groups (all P<0.01, except M4-M0 of HAMD). At M2, the severity of MMSE, HAMD, HAMA, PSQI and MBI in the IDSA group was significantly lower than that in the SCT and TSA groups (all P<0.01). There was no serious AE during this trial. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): IDSA can not only significantly improve cognitive function, but also reduce depression, anxiety, which finally improves the patient's self-care ability. The effect of IDSA was significantly better than SCT and TSA.

N2  - Background: The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is expected to increase over the next years, therefore, new methods able to prevent and delay cognitive decline are needed. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined treatment protocol associating a computerized cognitive training (CoRe) with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). <ovid:br/>Method(s): In this randomized controlled trial, 33 patients in the early stage of cognitive impairment were assigned to the experimental group (CoRE + real tDCS) or control group (CoRE + sham tDCS). In each group, the intervention lasted 3 consecutive weeks (4 sessions/week). A neuropsychological assessment was administered at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and 6-months later (T2). <ovid:br/>Result(s): The CoRE + real tDCS group only improved in working memory and attention/processing speed at both T1 and T2. It reported a stable MMSE score at T2, while the CoRE + sham tDCS group worsened. Age, mood, and T0 MMSE score resulted to play a role in predicting treatment effects. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Combined multi-domain interventions may contribute to preventing or delaying disease progression.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared diagnostic rates and clinical predictors of discrepancies between diagnoses conferred via: 1) a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation and National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria versus 2) a cognitive screener and Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria. DESIGN: Cross-sectional examination of baseline data from the Prevention of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) using Cognitive remediation and transcranial direct current stimulation in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Depression (PACt-MD; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02386670) trial. SETTING: Five geriatric psychiatry and memory clinics located at academic hospitals affiliated with the Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (N = 431) with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) in remission, MCI, or both. MEASUREMENTS: Main outcome was a comparison of NIA-AA diagnostic rates of MCI or dementia versus DSM-5 rates of mild or major neurocognitive disorder. Secondary analyses examined demographic, race, gender, premorbid intellectual ability, psychosocial, health-related, and genetic predictors of discrepancy between DSM-5 and NIA-AA diagnoses. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): There were 103 (23.8%) discrepant cases, with most (91; 88.3%) of these discrepant cases reflecting more impairment with the detailed neuropsychological testing and NIA-AA criteria. Discrepancies were more likely in individuals with a history of MDD or who had at least one ApoE4 allele. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): The NIA-AA criteria, in conjunction with comprehensive neuropsychological testing, identified a greater prevalence of cognitive impairment than DSM-5 criteria, in conjunction with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Detailed neuropsychological evaluations are recommended for older adults who have a history of MDD or a genetic vulnerability to dementia.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021

N2  - Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) accompanied by cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) are known risk factor for developing dementia. Yoga has been identified as a safe practice with positive effects on cognitive functions in healthy elderly and older adults at risk for cognitive decline. While yoga commonly involves postures (=asanas), focus on breath (=pranayama), postural alignment, and movement, brief meditative practices are also beneficial for brain health and cognition. Kirtan Kriya (KK), a yogic meditation, is associated with improved mood, cognition, and quality of life in SCD and MCI. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of Kundalini yoga paired with Kirtan Kriya meditation (YOGA) and memory enhancement training (MET) on mood and cognitive functioning in a group of older women with CVRFs and SCD (clinicaltrials.gov=NCT03503669). INTERVENTIONS: The YOGA intervention consisted of weekly, 60-minute in-person classes with a certified instructor for 12 weeks. In addition, each participant received a CD containing a 12-minute guided KK recording for daily homework practice. MET involved 12 weekly inperson group classes with 12 minute daily homework exercises. <ovid:br/>OUTCOME(S): Memory performance was the primary outcome. A delayed recall domain score was computed from the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Wechsler Memory Scale, and Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure 3-min Delay tests. An executive function domain score was calculated from the Stroop Interference and Trails B tests. Secondary outcomes included depression (BDI, Beck Depression Inventory), anxiety (HAM-A, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), stress (PSS, Perceived Stress Scale), resilience (CD-RISC, Connor-Davidson Resilience scale), subjective memory (MFQ, Memory Functioning Questionnaire; Factor 1=Frequency of Forgetting; Factor 2: Seriousness of Forgetting), and healthrelated quality of life (SF-36, 36-Item Short Form Survey). Outcomes were measured at 12-weeks and 24-weeks follow-up. BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES: Peripheral whole blood samples were collected at baseline, 12-weeks, and 24-weeks follow-up for RNA sequencing and cytokine/chemokine assays. RNA-SEQ: RNA Sequencing was performed on 2 Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 lanes for 2x150 cycles in paired-end mode, generating 150 bp sequencing reads (mean ~30 million reads/sample). Differential gene expression was tested using negative binomial generalized linear models (DeSeq2 and edgeR, R 4.1). CYTOKINE/CHEMOKINE ASSAY: Human 38-plex magnetic cytokine/chemokine kits (EMD Millipore, HCYTMAG-60K-PX38, Burlington, MA) were used per manufacturer's instructions. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Outcomes (clinical and cytokine/chemokine concentrations) were analyzed using a mixed effects general linear model (SAS 9.4), including intervention group, time, and the interaction between time and intervention group. Age, sex, and education were used as covariates (only for cognitive outcomes). Post-hoc analyses determined the significance of specific pair-wise group differences and within-group changes. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated for clinical outcomes. <ovid:br/>Result(s): CLINICAL OUTCOMES: A total of 79 participants (YOGA = 40; MET = 39) were randomized and 63 completed the 24-week follow-up (YOGA = 65% completion rate; MET = 95%; chi<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup>(1)=10.9, p < 0.001). Mean age of participants was 66.5 (SD = 9.2) years and mean MMSE was 28.4 (SD = 1.4). At 12-weeks and 24-weeks follow-up, both interventions demonstrated improvement in frequency of forgetting (MFQ-Factor 1). Between group differences were not significant (F(1, 76)=0.2, p = 0.7). At 24- weeks, YOGA participants demonstrated between- and withingroups improvements in seriousness of forgetting/MFQ-Factor 2 (YOGA mean change (SD) = 0.65 (1.25), t(76)=2.1, p = 0.04; MET mean change (SD) = -0.31(1.35), t(76)=-0.9, p = 0.4; F(1, 76)=4.9, p = 0.03; effect size (95% confidence interval)=-0.73 (-1.26, -0.19)). YOGA participants demonstrated between- and within-groups decline in delayed recall scores at 24-weeks (YOGA mean change (SD) = -0.31(0.37 t(76)=-3.8, p = 0.0003; MET mean change (SD = 0.02 (0.55), t(76)=0.5, p = 0.6; F(1, 76)=10.3, p = 0.002; effect size (95% confidence interval=0.19 (-0.32, 0.70)). Executive functioning, however, showed no between- or within-groups differences (F(1, 76)=0.8, p = 0.4). GENE EXPRESSION: Compared to MET, at 12- and 24-weeks follow-up, YOGA uniquely modulated targets related to interferon signaling and innate and adaptive immunity. CYTOKINE/CHEMOKINE CONCENTRATIONS: Compared to YOGA, MET participants displayed higher Eotaxin-1 levels (F(2,67)=3.94, p = 0.02) at 12- and 24-weeks follow-up. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): At 24-weeks follow-up, YOGA yielded a significant, large effect size improvement in subjective cognitive impairment compared to MET. On a transcriptional level, YOGA is a robust mediator of psycho-neuro-immune pathways, including suppression of several typically pro-inflammatory molecules. Eotaxin-1 levels increased over time in MET but not YOGA participants. Eotaxin-1 levels have been shown to increase with age and cognitive decline. These results suggest clinical and biological benefits of YOGA for SCD in menopausal women at risk for Alzheimer's disease due to cardiovascular disease, linking changes in cognition to anti-inflammatory effects of yoga.

N2  - Research Objectives: A few cognitive training studies have purported that maximal gains are achieved with intense, challenging, and multitask training. Yet, proof-of-concept is currently lacking. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of an enhanced cognitive training program to improve cognitive functions in older adults. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Within-group pre- to post-training quasi-experimental design. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): Academic institution. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Eighteen older adults (age 76+/-6); 18% women; MMSE scores 28+/-2) enrolled in the study. Fourteen (78%) completed pre-training and post-training assessments. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): Participants trained on the driving simulator for four weeks, three days per week for a total of 12 hours. Training involved following a lead car. The difficulty level of the training sessions was altered by changing the speed of the lead car, the following distance of the driver, visibility and weather conditions, and ambient traffic. <ovid:br/>Main Outcome Measure(s): Participants completed a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests evaluating memory, visuospatial skills, word finding, and cognitive flexibility pre- and post-intervention. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Pre- to post-training changes were examined using Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Participants improved on the California Verbal Learning Test short delay free recall (2.31+/-1.75; p=0.001) and delayed recall (1.69+/-1.89; p=0.009); Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure immediate recall (5.73+/-6.10; p=0.002) and delayed recall (2.54+/-4.61; p=0.05); Logical Memory immediate (3.61+/-4.89; p=0.02) and delayed (4.38+/-4.77; p=0.009) total scores; and Boston Naming Test total score (3.58+/-8.67; p=0.002). No changes were observed in performance on Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale tests. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The enhanced cognitive training in a driving simulator improved several memory domains. This pilot study warrants an adequately powered randomized controlled trial to better determine the short- and long-term effects of enhanced cognitive training on cognition and daily-life activities in older adults. Author(s) Disclosures: The authors report a financial conflict of interest. The training scenarios were played on the Portable Driving Simulator. H.D. and A.E.A. stand to profit from the sales of the Portable Driving Simulator. H.D. and A.E.A. were not involved in the training sessions or assessments.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022

N2  - Background: Practice-based evidence can inform and support clinical decision making. Case-report series about the implementation of programs in real-world clinical settings may contribute to verifying the effectiveness of interventions for treating PPA in specific contexts, as well as illustrating challenges that need to be overcome. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To describe and provide practice-based evidence on the effectiveness of four cognitive rehabilitation programs designed for individuals with PPA and directed to speech and language impairments, which were implemented in a specialized outpatient clinic. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Multiple single-case study. Eighteen individuals with different subtypes of PPA were each assigned to one out of four training programs based on comprehensive speech and language assessments. The treatments targeted naming deficits, sentence production, speech apraxia, and phonological deficits. Pre-and post-treatment assessments were undertaken to compare trained and untrained items. Gains were generalized to a different task in the first two types of intervention (naming and sentence production). A follow-up assessment was conducted 1-8 months after treatment among 7 participants. <ovid:br/>Result(s): All individuals presented better performance in the trained items at the post-test for each rehabilitation program accomplished, demonstrating that learning of the trained strategies was achieved during the active phase of treatment. For 13 individuals, statistical significance was reached; while for five, the results were maintained. Results about untrained items, generalization to other tasks, and follow-up assessments are presented. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The positive results found in our sample bring some practice-based evidence for the benefits of speech and language treatment strategies for clinical management of individuals with PPA.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the authors.

N2  - There is a lack of digital resources that support the cognition and quality of life (QoL) of people with dementia. The individual cognitive stimulation therapy application (iCST app) aims to provide cognitive stimulation and social interaction to people with dementia and carers through interactive touch-screen technology. This study set out to determine the feasibility of conducting a full-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with the iCST app. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This was a single blind, feasibility RCT including people with mild to moderate dementia and their carers. Multiple trial components were assessed including recruitment and retention rates, intervention fidelity and usability, and acceptability of the outcome assessments which included measures of cognition and QoL. A sample of the intervention group was invited to a semi-structured post-trial interview to examine the experience of using the iCST app. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Sixty-one dyads were randomised to the iCST app (n = 31) or treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group (n = 30) for 11 weeks. In the iCST app group, 77% used the intervention for 20 minutes or more each week. Carers using the iCST app rated their QoL better at follow-up 2 compared to the TAU control group (EQ-5D, MD = 7.69, 95% CI = 2.32-13.06, p = 0.006). No significant differences were found on the other outcome measures. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The iCST app was deemed usable and enjoyable. Most participants completed the activities more quickly than anticipated and did not have enough activities to continue using the app frequently. Expansion of the iCST app is needed to maintain engagement for longer. Findings indicate that computerised cognitive stimulation can be beneficial, and a large-scale RCT is feasible with modifications to trial components. The results are relevant to researchers, software developers, policy-makers, people with dementia and carers who are looking to be involved in such interventions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Rai et al.

N2  - In this work we aimed to identify neural predictors of the efficacy of multimodal rehabilitative interventions in AD-continuum patients in the attempt to identify ideal candidates to improve the treatment outcome. Subjects in the AD continuum who participated in a multimodal rehabilitative treatment were included in the analysis [n = 82, 38 Males, mean age = 76 +/- 5.30, mean education years = 9.09 +/- 3.81, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) mean score = 23.31 +/- 3.81]. All subjects underwent an MRI acquisition (1.5T) at baseline (T0) and a neuropsychological evaluation before (T0) and after intervention (T1). All subjects underwent an intensive multimodal cognitive rehabilitation (8-10 weeks). The MMSE and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scores were considered as the main cognitive and behavioral outcome measures, and Delta change scores (T1-T0) were categorized in Improved (DELTAMMSE > 0; DELTANPI < 0) and Not Improved (DELTAMMSE <= 0; DELTANPI >= 0). Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest classification models were performed including neural markers (Medial Temporal Brain; Posterior Brain (PB); Frontal Brain (FB), Subcortical Brain indexes), neuropsychological (MMSE, NPI, verbal fluencies), and demographical variables (sex, age, education) at baseline. More than 50% of patients showed a positive effect of the treatment (DELTAMMSE > 0: 51%, DELTANPI < 0: 52%). LR model on DELTAMMSE (Improved vs. Not Improved) indicate a predictive role for MMSE score (p = 0.003) and PB index (p = 0.005), especially the right PB (p = 0.002) at baseline. The Random Forest analysis correctly classified 77% of cognitively improved and not improved AD patients. Concerning the NPI, LR model on DELTANPI (Improved vs. Not Improved) showed a predictive role of sex (p = 0.002), NPI (p = 0.005), PB index (p = 0.006), and FB index (p = 0.039) at baseline. The Random Forest reported a classification accuracy of 86%. Our data indicate that cognitive and behavioral status alone are not sufficient to identify best responders to a multidomain rehabilitation treatment. Increased neural reserve, especially in the parietal areas, is also relevant for the compensatory mechanisms activated by rehabilitative treatment. These data are relevant to support clinical decision by identifying target patients with high probability of success after rehabilitative programs on cognitive and behavioral functioning.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Di Tella, Cabinio, Isernia, Blasi, Rossetto, Saibene, Alberoni, Silveri, Sorbi, Clerici and Baglio.

N2  - Background: Current pharmacological and behavioral treatment options for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are limited, motivating a search for alternative therapies that might slow the progression of cognitive decline. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): We investigated the effectiveness of a cognition-focused mindfulness-based intervention. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An open-label, three arm randomized controlled trial was conducted at a public tertiary medical center. Older persons (ages 45-75; N=76) diagnosed with MCI were recruited and randomized into either mindfulness-based training (MBT), cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT), or treatment as usual (TAU). Participants in the intervention arms received 8 weekly 2-h sessions delivered in a group setting and engaged in home practice. Primary outcomes measures included changes in index scores for attention, immediate memory, and delayed memory as measured using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Depression was a secondary outcome. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Using intent-to-treat analysis, we found that participants receiving MBT showed significant improvements in global cognition (d=0.26; [95%CI 0.03-0.56]) and delayed memory (d=0.36; [95%CI 0.17-0.57]), with significantly greater improvements in delayed memory than CRT (etap2=0.10). However, there was no benefit of MBT over TAU. No change in depression was observed in the MBT group. Reductions in depression were associated with improvements in cognitive functioning in the MBT group only. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that a cognition-focused MBT did not improve cognitive functioning in MCI patients substantially more than spontaneous reversion rates, possibly as mood symptoms were not significantly alleviated in this group.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 - IOS Press.

N2  - Objective: While clozapine is recognized as the most effective antipsychotic for individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, its effects on neurocognition remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the neurocognitive effects of clozapine treatment to those of non-clozapine antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia and to examine the role of anticholinergic burden on cognitive impairments. <ovid:br/>Design(s): This was a naturalistic study. Cross-sectional data were drawn from participants with chronic schizophrenia in two clinical trials assessing cognition. Cognition was evaluated using the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). Anticholinergic burden was calculated for each medication using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scoring system. We stratified the participants treated with non-clozapine antipsychotics into high ACB score versus low ACB score groups. <ovid:br/>Result(s): One hundred and seventy participants were enrolled and treated with clozapine (n=58) or non-clozapine antipsychotics (n=112). We observed no significant differences in the MCCB T-scores between the clozapine and the total non-clozapine groups for the cognitive composite score and the seven domain scores. However, the non-clozapine high ACB group showed significant impairments in processing speed and attention/vigilance, in contrast to the non-clozapine low ACB group (p<0.05). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results show that cognitive effects of clozapine might be no different from other antipsychotics. Negative effects on neurocognition in participants treated with antipsychotics with a high ACB score were related to their total ACB score.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021, Matrix Medical Communications.

N2  - Introduction: Prospective memory (PM) is a multiphasic cognitive function important for autonomy and functional independence but is easily disrupted by pathological aging processes. Through cognitive simulation of perceptual experiences, mental imagery could be an effective compensatory strategy to enhance PM performance. Nevertheless, relevant research in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been limited, and the underlying mechanism of the therapeutic effect has not been sufficiently elucidated. The present study aimed to examine complex PM performances and the effect of mental imagery on each phase in older adults with MCI and to investigate the underlying cognitive mechanism from a process perspective. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Twenty-eight MCI and 32 normal aging controls completed a seminaturalistic PM task, in addition to a series of neuropsychological tests. Participants from each group were randomly assigned to a mental imagery condition or a standard repeated encoding condition before performing the PM task. Four indices were used to measure performance in the intention formation, intention retention, intention initiation, and intention execution phases of PM. Performances in each phase was compared between the 2 diagnostic groups and the 2 instruction conditions. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The MCI group performed worse than the normal aging group in the intention formation and intention retention phases. The participants in the mental imagery condition performed significantly better than those in the standard condition during the intention formation, intention retention, and intention execution phases, regardless of the diagnostic group. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between the group and condition during intention retention, showing that people with MCI benefited even more from mental imagery than normal aging in this phase. Performance in the intention retention phase predicted performance in the intention initiation and intention execution phases. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): PM deficits in MCI mainly manifest during planning and retaining intentions. Mental imagery was able to promote performance in all but the initiation phase, although a trend for improvement was observed in this phase. The effects of mental imagery may be exerted in the intention retention phase by strengthening the PM cue-action bond, thereby facilitating the probability of intention initiation and bolstering fidelity to the original plan during intention execution.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021

N2  - Background: Dementia affects mental health and psychological capital indicators, which disappear with gradual deterioration in mental and cognitive functions. Gradual loss of ability to function independently can cause negative emotional symptoms and even further reduce cognitive and functional impairment. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The current study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation on psychological capital in the elderly with dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The current quasi-experimental research was performed following a pre and-post test design with a control group. The effect of cognitive rehabilitation on psychological capital of patients aged 60-74 years who were admitted to the private Tehran clin-ics during 2020 was assessed. The convenience sampling method was used to select the participants. So that among eligible patients who had inclusion criteria, 11 were selected and then randomly divided into two groups. Lutans Psychological Capital Questionnaire was used to collect data. After the treatment, a post-test was carried out for all study groups. Data analysis was performed by analysis of covariance. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The results of the analysis of covariance indicated the effectiveness cognitive rehabilitation on psychological capital in the elderly with dementia (P < 0.05).<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021, Author(s).

N2  - There is increasing interest in identifying biological and imaging markers for the early detection of neurocognitive decline. In addition, non-pharmacological strategies, including physical exercise and cognitive interventions, may be beneficial for those developing cognitive impairment. The Feuerstein Instrumental Enrichment (FIE) Program is a cognitive intervention based on structural cognitive modifiability and the mediated learning experience (MLE) and aims to promote problem-solving strategies and metacognitive abilities. The FIE program uses a variety of instruments to enhance the cognitive capacity of the individual as a result of mediation. A specific version of the FIE program was developed for the cognitive enhancement of older adults, focusing on strengthening ori-entation skills, categorization skills, deductive reasoning, and memory. We performed a prospective interventional pilot observational study on older subjects with MCI who participated in 30 mediated FIE sessions (two sessions weekly for 15 weeks). Of the 23 subjects who completed the study, there was a significant improvement in memory on the NeuroTrax cognitive assessment battery. Complete sets of anatomical MRI data for voxel-based morphometry, taken at the beginning and the end of the study, were obtained from 16 participants (mean age 83.5 years). Voxel-based morphometry showed an interesting and unexpected increase in grey matter (GM) in the anterolateral occipital border and the middle cingulate cortex. These initial findings of our pilot study support the design of randomized trials to evaluate the effect of cognitive training using the FIE program on brain volumes and cognitive function.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Vostry M, Fischer S, Zukov I, Lankova B, Kupka M. Results of the research of the effectiveness of specific therapy for people with dementia in Alzheimer's disease with late onset Objective: The content of the article is the results of a research survey. The aim of the research was to determine the effect of intensive combination therapy using occupational therapy and psychotherapy elements on the cognitive performance and emotional state of people suffering from dementia in late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The research group was selected from facilities providing social services in the Usti Region. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): The research was conducted in N = 48 (100%) probands, with the representation of N = 35 (72.9%) women in the age range of 66.1-71.0 years and N = 13 (27.1%) men in the age range of 67.1-70.2 years with a diagnosis of dementia in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (according to ICD-10; F00.1). In addition to the mentioned relevant features, we recorded emotional disorders in the probands according to the analysis of medical documentation. The last decisive relevant feature was also active participation in the activities of the facility. The probands of the research group were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. In both groups, regular therapy was provided by the facility. The experimental group had an increased number of intensive therapies for 2 months (8 weeks) 5 times a week for about 50 minutes. The intervention took place with individual or group therapy. Auxiliary scientific forces took part in the intervention, performing regular practice at the time. Input and output testing was provided using standardized tests. In the area of cognitive performance was used MMSE (short test of cognitive functions) and in the area of emotional state was applied BDI-II (Beck's selfassessment scale of depression for adults). <ovid:br/>Result(s): The obtained results (at the level of significance a = 0.05) show that the observed experimental group achieved slightly better results in the observed period in comparison with the control group, in the field of cognitive performance. In the case of affectivity, the results after two months of follow-up in both groups were almost unchanged. In this case, we failed to demonstrate the effect of short-term intensive rehabilitation.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021, Czech Medical Association J.E. Purkyne. All rights reserved.

N2  - Reminiscence therapy (RT) is a form of cognitive stimulation therapy that incorporates discussion of past activities, events, and experiences to stimulate individual memories; it has had some success in treating persons with neurocognitive disorders. This research aims to evaluate the ability of individual RT, using a simple reminiscence format, to improve the overall cognitive function, memory, executive functions, emotional status, and quality of life in older adults with neurocognitive disorders who received social care and support services. A multicenter randomized controlled trial was completed in the Azores archipelago (an independent region of Portugal) using repeated measures (pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up). The intervention group underwent individual RT sessions, twice weekly for 13 weeks, while the control group completed regular activities administered as part of their program. Results did not reveal any significant differences between the intervention and control groups. While results did not reveal significant effects, a number of historical and contextual factors are considered as possible explanations for the lack of effects-namely, data collection occurring during the COVID-19 global pandemic, participant cohort effects, and therapist heterogeneity.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Through the process of normal aging, cognitive decline would cause a lower level of functioning in real life. This flow might interfere with health-related quality of life (QoL). The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of computer-based cognitive intervention on increasing QoL of elderly people. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A total number of 52 community-dwelling older adults participated in this study. This community scored >= 21 in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a clock drawing test score >= 4 from health centers in Tehran, Iran. This study is a parallel group stratified randomized clinical trial. The intervention group received a 45-min cognitive training session twice a week for 10 sessions, using Attentive Rehabilitation of Attention and Memory (ARAM) software focusing on selective attention and working memory. QoL was evaluated as a primary outcome. The control group participated in educational workshops. <ovid:br/>Result(s): From fifty-two persons, only one participant was excluded from the study in the intervention group during follow-up. Results revealed by increasing cognitive function, improvement occurred in QoL (F = 13.417, p value < 0.001, partial eta-squared = 0.324) as a primary outcome in the intervention group. Among eight domains of QoL, there was significant increasing in domain of role limitations due to emotional problems (F = 4.007, p value = 0.021, partial eta-squared = 0.059), social functioning (F = 2.423, p value = 0.044, partial eta-squared = 0.004), and role limitations due to physical health (F = 10.749, p value < 0.001, partial eta-squared = 0.026). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Based on the results, ARAM showed transition and long-term effects on QoL in elderly people by improving cognitive functions such as selective attention and working memory.

N2  - The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) can cause neurological, psychiatric, psychological, and psychosocial impairments. Literature regarding cognitive impact of COVID-19 is still limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate cognitive deficits and emotional distress among COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients who required functional rehabilitation. Specifically, this study explored and compared cognitive and psychological status of patients in the subacute phase of the disease (COVID-19 group) and patients in the postillness period (post-COVID-19 group). Forty patients admitted to rehabilitation units were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups according to the phase of the disease: (a) COVID-19 group (n = 20) and (b) post-COVID-19 group (n = 20). All patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment including Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). A larger part of the COVID group showed neuropsychological deficits in the total MMSE (35%) compared to the post-COVID group (5%), whereas the majority of both groups (75-70%) reported cognitive impairments in the total MoCA. The post-COVID group reported significantly higher score in MMSE subtests of language (p = 0.02) and in MoCA subtests of executive functions (p = 0.05), language (p = 0.01), and abstraction (p = 0.02) compared to the COVID group. Regarding emotional disturbances, ~40% of patients presented with mild to moderate depression (57.9-60%). The post-COVID-19 group reported significantly higher levels of distress at the IES-R compared to the COVID group (p = 0.02). These findings highlight the gravity of neuropsychological and psychological symptoms that can be induced by COVID-19 infection and the need for tailored rehabilitation, including cognitive training and psychological support.<ovid:br/>&#xa9; Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Pistarini, Fiabane, Houdayer, Vassallo, Manera and Alemanno.

N2  - Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a manualized psychosocial group intervention for people with mild to moderate dementia. Because of its broad scientific evidence and cost effectiveness, CST is now used globally. To ensure replicability and quality standards of the intervention in other cultures, Aguirre et al. (2014) developed guidelines for cultural adaptation of CST based on the formative method for adapting psychotherapy (FMAP). Following this community-based approach, we adapted and translated the English CST manual into German, including multiprofessional focus groups, two adaptation cycles, and two pilot CST groups (n = 13) in different settings representative of the German healthcare system. Effectiveness in both groups was assessed by pre-post comparison of standard scales on cognition, depression, quality of life, and self-efficacy. We were able to replicate previous findings of improved cognition as measured by the ADAS-Cog, with effect sizes in the same range as in previous randomized controlled trials. Additionally, self-efficacy increased in post-test compared to the pre-test, indicating that CST might trigger cognition through positive, self-rewarding activation.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

N2  - Objective: To innvestigate the rehabilitation effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with cognitive training on cognitive impairment in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) by using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Clinical data of 166 patients with cognitive impairment after TBI were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were assigned into an observation group and a control group according to different treatment methods, with 83 cases in each group. The observation group was given rTMS + cognitive training, and the control group was given cognitive training only. The changes in GCS score, the Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA and NAA/Cr ratios examined by MRSI, the score of cognitive impairment, the grading of cognitive impairment, and the changes in modified Barthel index were observed and compared between the two groups. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The GCS score, and the ratios of Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA and NAA/Cr after treatment were better than those before treatment in both groups and were lower in the observation group compared with the control group (all P<0.05). The score and grading of cognitive impairment as well as modified Barthel index after treatment were all significantly better in the observation group than in the control group (all P<0.05). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): rTMS can improve the rehabilitation effect on cognitive impairment in patients after TBI and is recommended for clinical use.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

N2  - Background: Cognitive functions are mental series of activities that allow us to carry out any activity. The most important cognitive functions are orientation, attention, memory, executive functions, language, and visuospatial skills. Cognitive impairment is a prevalent consequence of stroke. The prognosis of stroke recovery can be estimated through the severity of cognitive impairment. The objective of this research work was to compare the changes in cognitive functions of post-stroke patients with the computer-based cognitive intervention (CBCI) using the PABLO system and conventional cognitive intervention (CCI) using the paper-pencil method. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A total of 80 stroke patients with cognitive impairment were selected and divided into two groups. Group A received intervention through PABLO System (CBCI), and Group B received the cognitive intervention through the Paper Pencil method (CCI). Pre and post-assessment of cognitive functions like verbal fluency, language, orientation and attention, memory, visuospatial, and mini-mental state examination for both groups were done by Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination-revised (ACE-R) scale. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After the intervention of 4 weeks, patients of both groups showed improvement in cognitive functions. However, group A scored higher in comparison to group B. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Data suggest that both the interventions will bring changes in cognitive functions of post-stroke patients, but CBCI may be much more effective in improving the cognitive functions of stroke patients.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Backgrounds: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) and cognitive stimulation (CS) are the standard pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). <ovid:br/>Aim(s): The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of these treatments, alone or combined, on the neuropsychological profiles of patients with AD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Forty participants were assigned to three groups receiving either only AChEI (n = 14), AChEI + CS (n = 15), or only CS (n = 11). Cognition was evaluated at baseline and after three months. Linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate differences among the treatments in terms of changes in the patients' neuropsychological profiles. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Results, although preliminary because of the small sample size, suggest that a general improvement was found in patients who received AChEI + CS and those who received only CS compared with those who received only AChEI. Interestingly, individuals who received only CS showed a significant improvement in immediate memory recall than those who received only AChEI. Furthermore, the group receiving AChEI + CS showed an improvement in delayed recall than the other two groups. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): The combination of AChEI and CS seems to have the greatest benefit for patients with mild AD. More interestingly, CS alone is more effective than AChEI alone, even in improving memory, considered to be the "lost" cognitive domain in AD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Age-related dementia refers to a state in which someone experiences multiple cognitive function impairment due to degenerative brain disease, and which causes difficulties in their daily life or social life. Dementia is the most common and serious obstacle in later life. Early intervention in the case of patients who are in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage among the high-risk group can maintain and improve their cognitive function. The purpose of the current trial is aimed at investigating the association between a multi-component (exercise with cognitive) intervention program and habitual physical activity parameters on cognitive functions in MCI patients. Neuropsy-chological cognitive and depression assessments were performed by neuropsychologists according to normalized methods, including the Korean mini-mental State examination (K-MMSE) and modified Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) and cognitive assessment tool (attention, processing speed), and the Korean version of the geriatric depression scale (SGDS-K), both at baseline and at a 12 weeks follow-up. The 12-week multi-component intervention improved cognitive function and habitual physical activity parameters in patients with MCI relative to controls. A multi-component intervention program for patients with MCI is considered to be an effective method of dementia prevention by improving global (ADAS-Cog) and frontal (trail-making test, digit symbol substitution test) cognition and habitual physical activity parameters such as moderate to vigorous physical activity and step count. In addition, it is important to encourage habitual physical activities to ensure that exercise intervention strategies are carried out at the duration and intensity required for improving physical and cognitive wellbeing and obtaining health benefits.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Impairments of action semantics (a cognitive domain that critically engages motor brain networks) are pervasive in early Parkinson's disease (PD). However, no study has examined whether action semantic skills in persons with this disease can be influenced by non-invasive neuromodulation. Here, we recruited 22 PD patients and performed a five-day randomized, blinded, sham-controlled study to assess whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) over the primary motor cortex, combined with cognitive training, can boost action-concept processing. On day 1, participants completed a picture-word association (PWA) task involving action-verb and object-noun conditions. They were then randomly assigned to either an atDCS (n = 11, 2 mA for 20 m) or a sham tDCS (n = 11, 2 mA for 30 s) group and performed an online PWA practice over three days. On day 5, they repeated the initial protocol. Relative to sham tDCS, the atDCS group exhibited faster reaction times for action (as opposed to object) concepts in the post-stimulation test. This result was exclusive to the atDCS group and held irrespective of the subjects' cognitive, executive, and motor skills, further attesting to its specificity. Our findings suggest that action-concept deficits in PD are distinctively grounded in motor networks and might be countered by direct neuromodulation of such circuits. Moreover, they provide new evidence for neurosemantic models and inform a thriving agenda in the embodied cognition framework.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the authors.

N2  - The use of ecologically oriented approaches with virtual reality (VR) depicting instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) is a promising approach for interventions on acquired brain injuries. However, the results of such an approach on dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still lacking. This research reports on a pilot randomized controlled trial that aimed to explore the effect of a cognitive stimulation reproducing several IADL in VR on people with mild-to-moderate dementia caused by AD. Patients were recruited from residential care homes of Santa Casa da Misericordia da Amadora (SCMA), which is a relevant nonprofit social and healthcare provider in Portugal. This intervention lasted two months, with a total of 10 sessions (two sessions/week). A neuropsychological assessment was carried out at the baseline and follow-up using established neuropsychological instruments for assessing memory, attention, and executive functions. The sample consisted of 17 patients of both genders randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The preliminary results suggested an improvement in overall cognitive function in the experimental group, with an effect size corresponding to a large effect in global cognition, which suggests that this approach is effective for neurocognitive stimulation in older adults with dementia, contributing to maintaining cognitive function in AD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Cognitive impairment after a stroke has a direct impact on patients' disability. In particular, impairment of Executive Functions (EFs) interferes with re-adaptation to daily life. The aim of this study was to explore whether adding a computer-based training on EFs to an ordinary rehabilitation program, regardless of the specific brain damage and clinical impairment (motor, language, or cognitive), could improve rehabilitation outcomes in patients with stroke. An EF training was designed to have minimal motor and expressive language demands and to be applied to a wide range of clinical conditions. A total of 37 stroke patients were randomly assigned to two groups: a training group, which performed the EF training in addition to the ordinary rehabilitation program (treatment as usual), and a control group, which performed the ordinary rehabilitation exclusively. Both groups were assessed before and after the rehabilitation program on neuropsychological tests covering multiple cognitive domains, and on functional scales (Barthel index, Functional Independence Measure). The results showed that only patients who received the training improved their scores on the Attentional Matrices and Phonemic Fluency tests after the rehabilitation program. Moreover, they showed a greater functional improvement in the Barthel scale as well. These results suggest that combining an EF training with an ordinary rehabilitation program potentiates beneficial effects of the latter, especially in promoting independence in activities of daily living.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Cognitive training can potentially prevent cognitive decline. However, the results of recent studies using semi-immersive virtual reality (VR)-assisted cognitive training are inconsistent. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): We aimed to examine the hypothesis that cognitive training using fully immersive VR, which may facilitate visuospatial processes, could improve visuospatial functioning, comprehensive neuropsychological functioning, psychiatric symptoms, and functional connectivity in the visual brain network in predementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Participants over 60 years old with subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment from a memory clinic were randomly allocated to the VR (n=23) or the control (n=18) group. The VR group participants received multidomain and neuropsychologist-assisted cognitive training in a fully immersive VR environment twice a week for 1 month. The control group participants did not undergo any additional intervention except for their usual therapy such as pharmacotherapy. Participants of both groups were evaluated for cognitive function using face-to-face comprehensive neuropsychological tests, including the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy task; for psychiatric symptoms such as depression, apathy, affect, and quality of life; as well as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) at baseline and after training. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of cognitive training between groups. Seed-to-voxel-based analyses were used to identify the cognitive improvement-related functional connectivity in the visual network of the brain. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After VR cognitive training, significant improvement was found in the total score (F1,39=14.69, P=.001) and basic components score of the RCFT copy task (F1,39=9.27, P=.005) compared with those of the control group. The VR group also showed improvements, albeit not significant, in naming ability (F1,39=3.55, P=.07), verbal memory delayed recall (F1,39=3.03, P=.09), and phonemic fluency (F1,39=3.08, P=.09). Improvements in psychiatric symptoms such as apathy (F1,39=7.02, P=.01), affect (F1,39=14.40, P=.001 for positive affect; F1,39=4.23, P=.047 for negative affect), and quality of life (F1,39=4.49, P=.04) were found in the VR group compared to the control group. Improvement in the RCFT copy task was associated with a frontal-occipital functional connectivity increase revealed by rsfMRI in the VR group compared to the control group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Fully immersive VR cognitive training had positive effects on the visuospatial function, apathy, affect, quality of life, and increased frontal-occipital functional connectivity in older people in a predementia state. Future trials using VR cognitive training with larger sample sizes and more sophisticated designs over a longer duration may reveal greater improvements in cognition, psychiatric symptoms, and brain functional connectivity.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

N2  - Background: In all types of dementia, cognitive abilities are affected, behaviour is altered and functional capacity is progressively lost. This cognitive deterioration manifests in the decrease of abilities required to perform the activities of daily living (ADL). The objective of this pilot study was to assess the effect of an Occupational Therapy programme based on the training of ADL through cognitive stimulation on the independence of ADL of persons with dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Institutionalized older adults with major neurocognitive disorder or dementia (N = 58) were randomly allocated to receive either the Occupational Therapy ADL cognitive stimulation programme or conventional Occupational Therapy. The cognitive level and the independence level performing ADL were measured at baseline (week 0), after 5 weeks of treatment (week 5) and after 6 weeks of follow up (week 12). A value of p < 0.05 and alpha = 0.0025 (Bonferroni correction) was considered as statistically significant. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The results obtained showed improvements in the level of independence performing ADLs in the intervention group compared to the control group (p = 0.006). The improvements were seen in relation to feeding (p = 0.001), dressing (p = 0.005) and bladder and bowel incontinence (p = 0.003), the changes observed in feeding are statistically significant. However, those improvements were not maintained after the follow up period. There were no significant changes in relation to the cognitive level (p = 0.741). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Occupational Therapy based on ADL cognitive stimulation can have a positive effect, increasing the independence of subjects with major neurocognitive disorder or dementia who are institutionalised.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Cognitive impairment is a common dysfunction after stroke that seriously affects the overall recovery of patients. Cognitive rehabilitation training is currently the main treatment to improve cognitive function, but its curative effect is limited. Acupuncture is a core component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and some previous clinical studies have shown that it might be effective in treating post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI), but further evidence from large-sample studies is needed. The overall objective of this trial is to obtain further data to develop an optimized acupuncture treatment for PSCI by comparing the effects of different acupuncture treatment methods on cognitive function in PSCI patients. Methods/design: In this multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial, 206 eligible stroke inpatients who meet the trial criteria will be randomly assigned to 2 groups: an electroacupuncture (EA) plus needle retention (NR) group and an EA group. Both groups of patients will undergo the same routine cognitive rehabilitation treatments. All treatments will be given 5 times per week for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes will be assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MOCA). The secondary outcome will be measured by the Barthel Index (BI). All outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, week 4, week 8, and the third and sixth month after the end of treatment. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): Our aim is to evaluate the effects of two different acupuncture treatment methods for treating PSCI patients. This study is expected to provide data to be used in developing an optimized acupuncture treatment method for PSCI treatment. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR1900027849.

N2  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative and progressive disease marked by the presence of motor and non-motor symptoms, as psychological and cognitive impairment. Physical exercises have been prescribed as complementary therapy for PD, and the type of intervention and duration of the intervention should be taken into account. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): We aimed to compare the effect of different exercise modalities (functional mobility, multimodal and cognitive) and length (4 and 8 months) on psychological and cognition in people with PD. This study followed the CONSORT extension for non-pharmacological trials. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In this randomized controlled trial, we assessed 107 participants between 2011 and 2013. At the end of 3 years, participants with PD (mild to moderate stages) who achieved the criteria were assessed considering 3 different groups of exercise: Multimodal (n = 38), Functional Mobility (n = 33) and Mental/Leisure (n = 36). All 3 interventions were performed for 32 weeks, twice a week, with 60 min for each session (64 sessions in total). Psychological and cognitive function were assessed at baseline and after 4 and 8 months. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The Functional Mobility and Mental/Leisure training had a potential effect on maintaining cognitive function (executive function, attention and work memory). The Multimodal training did not show a benefit for cognitive features and was not even able to delay the progressive decline in cognitive functions; however, this modality had a positive effect on physical stress after 8 months of exercise. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): An intervention that requires high complexity and specific activities, such as locomotor and cognitive exercise, provides a maintenance effect against the degeneration in cognition associated with the progression of PD and thus can delay the progressive decline in cognitive function in PD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020

N2  - Introduction: Assessing the benefit of cognitive rehabilitation (CR) remains difficult. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An observational study was conducted in 33 patients with early-stage Alzheimer disease and their caregiver included in a clinical CR program at home, compared to 17 patients who received usual treatment. Evaluation of patient's dependence and objective and subjective caregiver's burden was performed by the caregiver with a research tool focusing on impairment in daily activities related to cognitive deficits. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Repeated measures analysis of variance showed a time by group interaction (P <.05), with decreased patient's dependence for adapted activities at 1 year in the CR group. Lawton scale for daily activities showed also a time by group interaction (P <.05), with increased dependence at 1 year in the control group. There was a significant decrease in Mini-Mental State Examination scores in both groups at 1-year follow-up (P <.05). Concerning caregiver's subjective burden, there was a trend for the time by group interaction (P =.07), and post hoc Tukey test showed that subjective burden was decreased in the CR group (P <.05). This was confirmed by nonparametric Mann-Whitney analysis on differences between follow-up and baseline evaluation (P <.05). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This observational study in a clinical setting is in line with the benefit of CR reported in recent randomized controlled trials. The benefit obtained for adapted daily activities remained after 1 year, even if global cognition declined. Moreover, caregiver's subjective burden related to all relevant daily activities evaluated within the CR program was decreased after 1 year in our clinical setting.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Background: Metamemory training (MMT) is a useful training strategy for improving cognitive functioning in the older adult population. Despite the advantages, there are limitations imposed by location and time constraints. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study aimed to develop a smart speaker-based MMT program and evaluate the efficacy of the program in older adults without cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This study used a case-control cohort design. The smart speaker-based MMT program comprised 3 training sessions per day, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks. Each training session took approximately 15 minutes. This program was implemented using smart speakers, not human trainers. All participants completed the Mini-Mental State Examination, Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire, Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span Test, fluency tests, and a short-form version of the Geriatric Depression Scale before and after training. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 60 subjects (29 in the MMT group and 31 in the control group) participated in the study. The training group showed significant increases in the delayed free recall, digit span forward, digit span backward, and fluency test scores compared with the control group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study confirmed the efficacy of smart speaker-based MMT in older adults. Home-based smart speaker-based MMT is not limited with respect to location or constrained by space and may help older adults with subjective cognitive decline without requiring intervention by human professionals.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Jeongsim Kim, EunJi Shin, KyungHwa Han, Soowon Park, Jung Hae Youn, Guixiang Jin, Jun-Young Lee.

N2  - Purpose: The study aimed at comparing the effects of a neuromotor multicomponent training program (MCTP) on executive function, functional fitness, blood pressure, body composition and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), compared with a concurrent strength and endurance exercise training program (CONTROL-EXE) and a cognitive training program (CONTROL-COG). <ovid:br/>Method(s): 56 older women (73 +/- 6 years) completed the 30-weeks intervention. The three groups attended two 60-min sessions per week and they were assessed before and after the intervention. <ovid:br/>Result(s): MCTP showed a moderate improvement in Stroop C condition (28 +/- 7 vs 32 +/- 8 correct items; p = 0.001; d = 0.53) and Stroop interference score (-7.4 +/- 7.3 vs -3.7 +/- 6.1; p = 0.035; d = 0.55), while no changes were observed among control groups. MCTP showed a small to moderate improvement in Timed Up and Go test (TUGT) (5.85 +/- 0.58 vs 5.46 +/- 0.56 s; p < 0.001; d = 0.71) and Chair-Stand test (CST) (18 +/- 4 vs 19 +/- 4 repetitions; p < 0.001; d = 0.47); while CONTROL-EXE only improved moderately at TUGT (7.02 +/- 1.1 vs 6.44 +/- 0.91 s; p = 0.005; d = 0.59) and CONTROL-COG showed a moderate to small worsening in TUGT, CST and handgrip strength. Additionally, MCTP enhanced body composition and HRQOL. Lastly, both exercise groups showed lowered blood pressure values. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that a neuromotor MCTP could be considered as a highly suitable training to enhance executive function, functional fitness, HRQOL and body composition in older women.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - (1) Combining aerobic, coordination and cognitive training allows for more improved physical and cognitive performance than when performed separately. A Nordic walking (NW) and two cognitive-motor circuit training programs (CT-c and CT-fit) are compared. CT-c and CT-fit stimulate cognition differently: CT-c, is through conventional complex coordination training performed in single and dual-task conditions; CT-fit, incorporates it into complex goal-directed actions, implemented by fitness gaming technology (2) The aim is to determine whether CT-fit brings additional benefits to cognition compared to more traditional training. (3) Forty-five healthy independent living community dwellers participants (65-80 years) will be included after a general medical examination. The main exclusion criteria are signs of cognitive impairments (Mini-Mental State Examination < 26/30) and physical impairments. Pre and post-tests will be performed to assess: cognitive functions (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; Trail Making Test; Stroop task, working memory test, Rey Complex Figure copy task, Oral Trail Making Test, and dual-task); motor fitness (Bipedal and unipedal balance test, gait assessments, Time Up and Go, chair sit and reach test and four-square stepping test); and physical fitness (10 m incremental shuttle walking test, maximal handgrip force, Timed-Stands test). (4) Incorporating cognitive demands into complex, goal-directed actions using fitness gaming technology should be the best solution to optimize training benefits.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Introduction: Rehabilitative treatments, based on cognitive stimulation (CS), have been recently proposed as useful approaches to improve or stabilize cognitive functions in patients with mild or moderate cognitive impairment [1]. The aim of this study is to verify if, in chronic post-stroke patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment, CS delivered from a distance by a telerehabilitation system, may improve cognitive performances and/or activities of daily living. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A population of consecutive outpatients were enrolled for examination at the Neurorehabilitation Unit of Institute Sant'Anna of Crotone. The enrolled patients were randomized in two groups. The telerehabilitation group has received a session of specific CS treatment delivered at home, from a distance by a Telerehabilitation system. The control group has received the usual outpatients care. Before and after treatment, a trained researcher will blindly has administered the clinical evaluations. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The mean MMSE score improved significantly after CS treatments, delivered from a distance by a telerehabilitation system. Key conclusions: The telerehabilitation could supply homebound subjects with treatments, without displacement of therapist or patient [2].

N2  - Background:It's been proved that cognitive stimulation (CS) has direct effects over the improvement of generalcognitive functions in people with cognitive impairment (PCI). The restrictions in daily life associated toCOVID-19 pandemic had an impact in the quality of life of PCI and it might have affected the efficacy ofthe CS programs targeting this population.Research Objective:To analyse if there was a moderating effect of the pandemic on the efficacy of CS programs. <ovid:br/>Method(s):Participants were enrolled in a public memory clinic; 213 PCI were assigned to two groups: 173 receivedCS treatment before the pandemic (PRECOVID) and 40 received CS during the pandemic (COVID). Preand post assessments were carried out with the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), the clock-test and thebrief Geriatric Depression Scale. The treatment consisted of 32 sessions of CS held twice a week during 4months. No significant differences (p<.05) were found between groups at baseline in age (74.46+/-7.80years), cognitive function (MMSE=23.43+/-3.30), gender (58% women) and the remaining variables. Preliminary results of the ongoing study:After treatment, both samples improved in depression (t = 4.56, p <.05), the COVID group improved inMMSE (t =-3.40, p <.05) and clock-test (t=-3.78, p <.05), the rest of the changes were not significant.Between group effect sizes favoured the COVID group intervention for MMSE (dc = 0.74) and the clocktest (dc = 0.48). No between group differences were found for depression (dc =-0.48). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s):Older people participating of CS during the pandemic benefited more from the treatment than thoseparticipating before the pandemic. This apparently contradictory result might be explained by thecontext of lack of social, emotional and cognitive stimulation associated to the restrictions inherent tosocial confinement. The continuity of CS care to PCI is essential in the context of generalised restrictionsin daily life associated to COVID-19 pandemic and might play an important role in preventing cognitiveloss and associated disabilities.

N2  - Background and aims: The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is expected to increase over the next years, therefore new methods able to prevent and delay cognitive decline are needed. The aim of this prospective double-blind 2-arm Randomized Controlled Trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined treatment protocol associating an computerized cognitive training with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). <ovid:br/>Method(s): Thirty-three patients (14 females; mean age = 74.18, SD = 5.59) in the early stage of cognitive impairment (i.e. with a diagnosis of aMCI or mild AD) were enrolled and randomly assigned to the experimental group (CoRe + real tDCS) or control group (CoRe + sham tDCS). All patients were evaluated with an exhaustive neuropsychological assessment before (T0) and after (T1) treatment. A post-treatment follow-up visit was scheduled 6 months (T2) after the end of the treatment. Treatment consisted in 12 individual sessions of about 45 min of cognitive training with multi-domain CoRe combined with online tDCS. Being adaptive, CoRe allows the possibility to generate different patient-tailored exercises. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We found that patients who received the real stimulation improved in working memory and attention/processing speed at both T1 and T2. Moreover, they reported a stable global cognitive functioning (MMSE) at T2, while patients in the control group worsened. In addition, age, mood, and initial cognitive functioning resulted to play a role in predicting treatment effects. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our findings confirm the importance of adopting a combined (i.e. cognitive training + tDCS) multi-domain intervention, as it may facilitate the development of compensatory mechanisms.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021

N2  - Background: Metamemory training is a type of useful training program for improving cognitive functioning in old age. Despite these advantages, there are limitations imposed by location or time constraints. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study aimed to develop a smart speaker-based metamemory training and evaluate the efficacy of the smart speaker-based metamemory training in older adults without cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This was a case-control cohort study. The speaker-based metamemory training program is comprised of three sessions per day for 8 weeks. Each training session took about 15 minutes. This program was implemented using smart speakers, not human trainers. All participants completed the Mini-Mental State Examination, Subjective Memory Complaint Questionnaire, Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span and Fluency tests, and Geriatric Depression Scale before and after training. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 60 subjects (29 in the training group and 31 in the control group) participated in the study. The training group showed significant increases in the delayed free recall, digit span forward, digit span backward, and fluency test scores compared to the control group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study confirmed the efficacy of smart speakerbased metamemory training in older adults. Home-based smart speaker-based metamemory training is not limited with respect to location or constrained by space, and may help older adults with subjective cognitive decline without requiring intervention by human professionals.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Singapore sees more than 7,000 ischemic stroke cases yearly, with majority having physical and cognitive sequelae. Previous reports demonstrate that Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) occurs in 37.3% of stroke patients at the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI, Singapore) within 6 months post-stroke. The severity of rising PSCI rates prompted the implementation of the NNI Stroke Memory Rehabilitation Programme (SMaRT) for ischaemic stroke patients with mild physical impairments. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of the SMaRT programme on PSCI and post-stroke coping over a 6-month period. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): The SMaRT programme is a 8-week group-based post-stroke cognitive rehabilitation programme focusing on healthy living habits, memory models, memory strategies and emotion regulation strategies. Patients with clinically diagnosed ischaemic strokes, mild functional and cognitive issues (modified Rankin Scale score<=3 and Mini Mental-State Examination score>=20) were recruited from April 2018 to September 2020. Assessments were administered at baseline, 8 weeks and 6 months post-SMaRT, measuring global cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Visual Cognitive Assessment Tool), visuospatial function/attention (Trail Making Test-A), emotional coping (Geriatric Depression Scale-15), daily functioning (Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL)), subjective quality of life (Dementia Quality of Life (DemQOL)). Paired samples t-tests compared scores between the three timepoints, adjusting for type I errors with Bonferroni correction. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): 137 subjects (N males=90 (65.7.%); mean age=63.49 years, SD=9.38, mean years of education=9.50, SD=3.79) underwent SMaRT. Comparing week-8 to baseline, there was significant improvement in global cognition (MoCA, VCAT: p<.001), emotional coping (GDS, p<.001), daily functions (NEADL, p<.001), subjective quality of life (DemQOL: p=.008). Significant improvement was also observed comparing month-6 to baseline scores in global cognition (MoCA, VCAT: p<.001), emotional coping (GDS, p<.001), daily functions (NEADL, p<.001), subjective quality of life (DemQOL: p<.001). In both analyses, decreasing trends in TMT-A (seconds) were observed and approached significance. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): The SMaRT programme is effective in mitigating post-stroke cognitive impairment, particularly in global cognition. Additionally, SMaRT improved mood, daily functioning and subjective quality of life, suggesting its ability to instill positivity and confidence in stroke patients. These suggest a group-based structured cognitive rehabilitation programme is likely to benefit stroke patients and reduces incidence of PSCI.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 the Alzheimer's Association.

N2  - Objectives: Physical activity in people with dementia (PwD) may enhance physical and mental functioning. Exergaming, which combines physical exercise with cognitive stimulation in a gaming environment, was developed to overcome barriers in performing physical activities. We evaluated the effects of exergaming in day care centers (DCCs) for PwD and informal caregivers (ICs). <ovid:br/>Design(s): A randomized controlled trial among 23 DCCs across the Netherlands randomized to exergaming (interactive cycling during 6 months) or a care-as-usual control group. Setting and Participants: A total of 112 (73 exergaming, 39 control) community-dwelling dyads (PwD, IC), with the PwD visiting a DCC at least twice per week. <ovid:br/>Method(s): All outcomes were assessed using structured questionnaires during interviews with PwD and ICs at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), and 6 months (T2). Primary outcomes: physical activity and mobility of the PwD. <ovid:br/>Secondary Outcomes: physical, cognitive, emotional and social functioning, and quality of life for PwD. For ICs: experienced burden, quality of life, and positive care experiences. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Mixed-model analyses showed no statistically significant effects on primary outcomes. There were statistically significant positive effects on PwD's secondary outcomes at T2 on cognition [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): r = 2.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65, 3.96, P = .007; and Trail Making Test part A (TMT-A): r = -28.98, 95% CI: -54.89, -3.08, P = .029], social functioning (Behavior Observation Scale for Intramural Psychogeriatrics subscale 1 (GIP): r = -1.86, 95% CI: -3.56, -0.17, P = .031), and positive post-test effects in ICs on distress caused by the PwD's neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q total distress: r = -3.30, 95% CI: -6.57, -0.03, P = .048) and on sense of competence (SSCQ: r = 2.78, 95% CI: 0.85, 4.71, P = .005). Conclusions and Implications: Exergaming appeared not effective on the primary outcomes. Despite the study being underpowered, we found positive effects on secondary outcomes for PwD and ICs, and no negative effects. We therefore recommend further study, dissemination, and implementation.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine. Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The aim of this study was to examine cortical thickness changes associated with a multicomponent exercise intervention combining physical exercise and cognitive training in older adults with cognitive decline. This study involved a secondary analysis of neuroimaging data from a randomized controlled trial with 280 older adults having cognitive decline who were randomly assigned to either a multicomponent exercise group (n = 140) that attended weekly 90-min exercise and cognitive training sessions or a health education control group (n = 140). The cortical thickness and cognitive performance were assessed at the baseline and at trial completion (10 months). The cortical thickness in the frontal and temporal regions was determined using FreeSurfer software. Cognitive performance was evaluated using the Gerontology-Functional Assessment Tool (NCGG-FAT). The cortical thickness significantly increased in the middle temporal (p < 0.001) and temporal pole (p < 0.001) in the multicomponent exercise group compared with the control group. Cortical thickness changes were significantly associated with change in trail making test (TMT)-A, TMT-B, and story memory after a 10-month multicomponent exercise intervention. This study suggests that multicomponent exercise programs combining physical exercise and cognitive training have important implications for brain health, especially in providing protection from age-related cortical thinning.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Intervention programs to relieve memory impairment and memory-related complaints in older adults with mild cognitive impairment are needed. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The purpose of the current study was to assess the efficacy of a novel cognitive training approach-named multi-strategic metamemory training-in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Among a total of 113 older adults with mild cognitive impairment, 66 participated in the memory training program (training group) and 47 did not (control group). Repeated measures of analysis of variance revealed that compared with the control group, the training group experienced: i) a significantly greater increase in cognitive test scores of long-term delayed free recall (F<ovid:inf>interaction</ovid:inf> = 6.04, p = .016) and fluency (F<ovid:inf>interaction</ovid:inf> = 4.11, p = .045) and ii) significantly greater decrease in their subjective memory complaints for everyday memory (F<ovid:inf>interaction</ovid:inf> = 7.35, p = .009). These results suggest that the training program can improve verbal memory (i.e., delayed free recall), language processing (i.e., categorical fluency) and limit complaints in everyday instrumental memory activities of mildly impaired older adults.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Ageing is a complex process that decreases the ability of different body systems. It effects both physical and psychological functions and decreases the quality of life. When elderly people were weak physically, this will increase the caregiver burden. Home based cognitive therapy was found to be effective in the management of cognitive functions in the elderly patients. The present study was conducted at selected community settings of Puducherry.A total of 314 elderly participants were recruited for the study after obtaining the written informed consent.After recruiting, the participants were randomly grouped into two groups that is control and intervention groups with 157 participants in each group. Home based cognitive training program was administered to the intervention group individuals. The results of the study supports that the home based cognitive training programme is beneficial in the management of elderly population with mild cognitive impairment. There was significant improvement in the quality of life of the elderly patients and also significant decrease in the care givers burden followed by the intervention. The study recommends further detailed studies in this area to adopt the home based cognitive training programme along with routine medical treatment.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

N2  - This outcome assessor-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial investigated the effects of electroacupuncture combined with computer-based cognitive rehabilitation (EA-CCR) on mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A per-protocol analysis was employed to compare the efficacy of EA-CCR to that of computer-based cognitive rehabilitation (CCR). Thirty-two patients with MCI completed the trial (EA-CCR group, 16; CCR group, 16). Patients received EA-CCR or CCR treatment once daily three days per week for eight weeks. Outcome (primary, ADAS-K-cog; secondary, MoCA-K, CES-D, K-ADL, K-IADL, and EQ-5D-5L) measurements were performed at baseline (week 0), at the end of the intervention (week 8), and at 12 weeks after completion of the intervention (week 20). Both groups showed significant changes in ADAS-K-cog score (EA-CCR, p < 0.001; CCR, p < 0.001) and MoCA-K (EA-CCR, p < 0.001; CCR, p < 0.001). Only the EA-CCR group had a significant change in CES-D (p = 0.024). No significant differences in outcomes and in the results of a subanalysis based on age were noted between the groups. These results indicate that EA-CCR and CCR have beneficial effects on improving cognitive function in patients with MCI. However, electroacupuncture in EA-CCR showed no positive add-on effects on improving cognitive function, depression, activities of daily living, and quality of life in patients with MCI.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Despite several studies having reported on the cognitive effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), no studies, to date have addressed the long-term effects of rTMS with cognitive training (CT). This study was aimed to investigate the long-term effects of rTMS-CT in mild AD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Patients with mild AD (Mini-mental Status Examination [MMSE] score of 21-26), diagnosed based on the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-IV, were recruited and randomly allocated to two groups, treatment and sham, in a 2:1 ratio. We matched the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI)-only group to the treatment group to comparing the long-term effect of rTMS-CT. Treatment group was treated for 6 weeks with high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS-CT, whereas the other group received 6 weeks of the sham management. These groups underwent neuropsychological tests at baseline, immediately after rTMS-CT, and 6 weeks after the last rTMS-CT. Data of AChEI-only and treatment groups were analyzed changes of cognitive scores (MMSE, and clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes scales) over 3 years. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Among the 44 enrolled mild AD (mean age, 72.5 years; females, 36.4%), the rTMS-CT group (n = 30) showed improvement on the ADAS-Cog score for 12 weeks compared with the sham group (n = 14). The rTMS-CT group showed slower rates of neurodegeneration than those in the AChEI-only group (n = 60) during the 3 years of follow-up. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Compared to the administration of AChEI only, the use of rTMS-CT might be a useful supplementary interventional strategy in mild AD for long-term mitigation of neurodegeneration.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020, Taiwan Society of Geriatric Emergency & Critical Care Medicine.

N2  - Objective - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of cognitive and exercise rehabilitation training, and non-invasive brain stimulation on the gait of schizophrenic patients suffering from depression disorder. Methods - Fifty-five male schizophrenic patients suffering from depression disorder aged 24 to 66 years were assigned to either a control group (n=10), cognitive rehabilitation group (n=10), exercise rehabilitation training group (n=13), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) group (n=11) or multimodal intervention group (n=11). Gait was measured using a 10-meter gait speed test under normal, in dual-task cognitive-gait, and in dual task motor-gait conditions. Results - Gait speed during the 10-meter walk test under normal conditions was significantly (P<=0.05) different from pre- to post-test in the exercise rehabilitation training, and cognitive rehabilitation multimodal intervention. Gait speed during the dual task motor-gait condition was significantly different from pre- to post-test in the exercise rehabilitation training, cognitive rehabilitation and, multimodal intervention groups (P<=0.05). Gait speed during the dual task cognitive-gait condition significantly changed from pre- to post-test following exercise rehabilitation training, cognitive rehabilitation, tDCS and the multimodal intervention group (P<=0.05). Conclusion - This study's findings demonstrate that exercise rehabilitation training, cognitive rehabilitation, and multimodal interventions could assist with preventing falls within Schizophrenic patients suffering from depression and thereby improve their functional independence.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020, LLC Science and Innovations.

N2  - Objectives: To investigate the effect of omega-3 (omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation and a multidomain intervention (MI) (physical activity counselling, cognitive training and nutritional advice) among community-dwelling older adults on levels of intrinsic capacity (IC), a construct recently proposed by the World Health Organization. Study design: Secondary analysis from the factorial-design 3-year Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) with 1445 subjects (64.2 % female, mean age 75.3 years, SD = 4.4) randomized to one group of MI plus omega-3 (800 mg docosahexaenoic acid and 225 mg eicosapentaenoic acid/day); MI plus placebo; omega-3 supplementation alone; or placebo alone. Data collection was held between 2008 and 2014. <ovid:br/>Main Outcome Measure(s): IC domains were examined with the Geriatric Depression Scale (psychological); Short Physical Performance Battery (mobility); Z-score combining four tests (cognitive function); and handgrip strength (vitality). All domains were combined into a composite IC Z-score. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After 3 years, IC Z-score decreased among all groups when time was considered continuous (MI plus omega-3: -0.16, 95 %CI: -0.22 to -0.10; MI alone: -0.13, 95 %CI: -0.19 to -0.07; omega-3 alone: -0.19, 95 %CI: -0.25 to -0.10; placebo: -0.20, 95 %CI: -0.26 to -0.14; all p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences between groups. In a sensitivity analysis with categorical time, significant within-group declines were first identified at 24 months for all groups. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This trial designed to improve cognitive function was unable to find effects of the intervention on the composite IC Z-score. Further investigations are needed, especially trials providing stronger interventions (such as exercise training and a controlled diet) and also embracing the sensorial domain of IC.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Dementia affects 47 million individuals worldwide, and assuming the status quo is projected to rise to 150 million by 2050. Prevention of age-related cognitive impairment in older persons with lifestyle interventions continues to garner evidence but whether this can combat underlying neurodegeneration is unknown. The Study of Mental Activity and Resistance Training (SMART) trial has previously reported within-training findings; the aim of this study was to investigate the long-term neurostructural and cognitive impact of resistance exercise in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). For the first time we show that hippocampal subareas particularly susceptible to volume loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are protected by resistance exercise for up to one year after training. One hundred MCI participants were randomised to one of four training groups: (1) Combined high intensity progressive resistance and computerised cognitive training (PRT+CCT), (2) PRT+Sham CCT, (3) CCT+Sham PRT, (4) Sham physical+sham cognitive training (SHAM+SHAM). Physical, neuropsychological and MRI assessments were carried out at baseline, 6 months (directly after training) and 18 months from baseline (12 months after intervention cessation). Here we report neuro-structural and functional changes over the 18-month trial period and the association with global cognitive and executive function measures. PRT but not CCT or PRT+CCT led to global long-term cognitive improvements above SHAM intervention at 18-month follow-up. Furthermore, hippocampal subfields susceptible to atrophy in AD were protected by PRT revealing an elimination of long-term atrophy in the left subiculum, and attenuation of atrophy in left CA1 and dentate gyrus when compared to SHAM+SHAM (p = 0.023, p = 0.020 and p = 0.027). These neuroprotective effects mediated a significant portion of long-term cognitive benefits. By contrast, within-training posterior cingulate plasticity decayed after training cessation and was unrelated to long term cognitive benefits. Neither general physical activity levels nor fitness change over the 18-month period mediated hippocampal trajectory, demonstrating that enduring hippocampal subfield plasticity is not a simple reflection of post-training changes in fitness or physical activity participation. Notably, resting-state fMRI analysis revealed that both the hippocampus and posterior cingulate participate in a functional network that continued to be upregulated following intervention cessation. Multiple structural mechanisms may contribute to the long-term global cognitive benefit of resistance exercise, developing along different time courses but functionally linked. For the first time we show that 6 months of high intensity resistance exercise is capable of not only promoting better cognition in those with MCI, but also protecting AD-vulnerable hippocampal subfields from degeneration for at least 12 months post-intervention. These findings emphasise the therapeutic potential of resistance exercise; however, future work will need to establish just how long-lived these outcomes are and whether they are sufficient to delay dementia.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 The Author(s)

N2  - Objective: Recently, the area of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting neurological rehabilitation has been advanced as a potential treatment for post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). However, the underlying mechanisms remains to be elusived. This study aims to figure out cerebral functional manipulation of rTMS in patients with PSCI through using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). <ovid:br/>Method(s): Thirty patients with PSCI were recruited and randomly allocated into two groups: the rTMS intervention group and control group. The rTMS intervention group was given 20 min of 5 Hz rTMS (or control) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) besides routine cognitive intervention training for 3 consecutive weeks, five times per week, on weekdays. Cognition performance was assessed by the Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA). Neural activity and functional connectivity (FC) changes were acquired by rs-fMRI with fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and seed-based correlation analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Cognition improvements were observed both in rTMS intervention group and control group (P < 0.01), while the rTMS group got more significant improvent than control group (P < 0.05). To be specified, compared with the control group, the rTMS group got higher fALFF values in these brain regions including superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, while lower fALFF values in middle temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and fusiform gyrus. In addition, the rTMS group showed increased FC between LDPFC and toprecuneus, inferior temporal gyrus, middle and inferior frontal gyrus and marginal gyrus, while decreased FC between LDPFC and middle temporal gyrus and thalamus. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The increase and decrease of neural activity and FC in cognition-related regions detected by rs-fMRI are good indicators to clarify the underlining mechanisms of rTMS on PSCI.<ovid:br/>&#xa9; Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Li, Luo, Yu, Yin, Li, Li and Fu.

N2  - Introduction: The behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are frequently associated with patients with dementia, aggravating their cognitive and behavioural status, which generates anguish for their main caregivers. Non-pharmacological therapies are a method to approach BPSD. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): To analyse the effectiveness of a behavioural educational intervention and support to the family caregiver in reducing overload, and whether this reduction has a positive impact on the BPSD of the patient with dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A randomised, controlled, double-blind trial was conducted with patients with dementia and their principal caregivers (PC). The PC were randomised to either the intervention (IG) or control group (CG). The intervention comprised an individual cognitive-behavioural education intervention performed by outpatient nursing, with periodic telephone contacts, over 3 months. The CG received treatment as usual. Cognitive function was assessed using the cognitive scale Mini-Mental State Exploration (MMSE), Neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI-10) and depressive Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). And caregiver-reported burden using the Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory. The qualitative and qualitative data of the BPSD were collected at baseline and after the intervention. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The mean total age of the patients was 78.96 (+/- 6.64) years, and 50% were men. And in the PC (n = 28) it was 58.64 (+/- 11.69) years, and 92.9% were women. The IG (n = 13) showed a better score than the CG (n = 15) in the MMSE P<.001 and the GDS P<.001, although without changes in the NPI-10 (P=0,419), between the start visit and at 3 months, indicating improvement in cognitive and depressive symptoms after the intervention. The PC also obtained statistically significant scores on the Zarit scale (P=.010). BPSD improved significantly in the IG: repetition P<.001, depression (P =.013), apathy and indifference (P=.003), sleep and diurnal rhythm disorders (P=.006), and eating disorders (P=.019) at 3 months. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03732521. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Non-pharmacological therapy of individual therapeutic-cognitive intervention targeted at caregivers and carried out by nursing personnel expert in its management, has a favourable impact on the control and reduction of the BPSD of patients with dementia.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Sociedad Espanola de Enfermeria Neurologica

N2  - Aging is a physiological process that leads to both biological and psychological changes. The brain undergoes structural changes as a part of aging. Accord-ing to the investigator's best knowledge and based on the extensive review, no structured study was conducted in India to test the effectiveness of cognitive training program. Hence, the present study was conducted to test the effectiveness of a home-based training program on select outcomes. A total of 314 elderly participants were recruited for the study after obtaining the written informed consent. After recruiting, the participants were randomly grouped into two groups, that is control and intervention groups, with 157 participants in each group. The intervention was administered to the experimental group. The present study results suggest that the home-based cognitive training program is effective in improving cognitive functions and daily life activities. The study recommends further detailed and multi-centered studies in this area to recommend the implementation of the program in the management of the cognitive impairments of the elderly.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.

N2  - In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), synaptic plasticity seems to be involved in cognitive improvement induced by cognitive training. The platelet amyloid precursor protein (APP) ratio (APPr), i.e., the ratio between two APP isoforms, may be a useful peripheral biomarker to investigate synaptic plasticity pathways. This study evaluates the changes in neuropsychological/cognitive performance and APPr induced by cognitive training in AD patients participating in the "My Mind Project". Neuropsychological/cognitive variables and APPr were evaluated in the trained group (n = 28) before a two-month experimental protocol, immediately after its termination at follow-up 1 (FU1), after 6 months at follow-up 2 (FU2), and after 24 months at follow-up 3 (FU3). The control group (n = 31) received general psychoeducational training for two months. Some memory and attention parameters were significantly improved in trained vs. control patients at FU1 and FU2 compared to baseline ( values). At FU3, APPr and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores decreased in trained patients.  APPr correlated significantly with the  scores of (i) MMSE at FU1, (ii) the prose memory test at FU2, and (iii) Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), the semantic word fluency test, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and the attentive matrices test at FU3. Our data demonstrate that the platelet APPr correlates with key clinical variables, thereby proving that it may be a reliable biomarker of brain function in AD patients.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Late life major depression (LLD) is often accompanied by cognitive deficits. When patients have specific deficits in cognitive control functions (CCD), they are not only distressing and debilitating, they often predict poor clinical outcomes such as reduced response to SSRI/SNRI antidepressants, increased disability, suicide and all-cause mortality. We recently reported that in an open label trial, our treatment designed to target these specific CCD with neuroplasticity-based computerized cognitive remediation (nCCR) improved depression and CCD in patients who failed to remit with conventional antidepressant treatment. This study tested the hypothesis that in patients with LLD who have failed at least one trial of an SSRI/SNRI antidepressant at an adequate dose for at least 8 weeks, nCCR will improve both depressive symptoms and the CCD associated with poor antidepressant response (i.e. semantic strategy, inhibition of prepotent responses) more than an active control group. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either 30 hours/ 4 weeks of neuroplasticity based computerized cognitive remediation (nCCR) designed to target CCD, or the active control condition matched for duration, engagement, reward, computer presentation, and contact with study staff. All participants and raters were blinded. Mixed effects model analysis the time effect (week) (F(1,71.22)=25.2, p<0.0001) and treatment group X time interaction (F(1,61.8)=11.37, p=.002) reached significance indicating that the slope of decline in MADRS was steeper in the nCCR-GD group. Further, the nCCR group improved their semantic clustering strategy(t(28)=9.5; p=.006), as well as performance on the Stroop interference condition, and cognitive flexibility (Trails B). Further, results transferred to memory performance, which was not a function trained by nCCR. clinicaltrials.gov.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020

N2  - Interventions for age-associated cognitive impairment are of increasing significance as populations age. Using N-back and memory strategy enhancement, the present study aimed to explore the feasibility of using, and outcomes of a working memory (WM) training program on visuospatial and verbal WM in older female adults. Older women from two comparable local health centers who scored 26 and higher on Mini-Mental State Examination were invited to participate. Women at one center (experimental group) received three sessions on memory enhancement techniques and a computerized training program with N-back. Women at the other center (control group) received three sessions on memory and aging and training on using various features of cellphones. All participants completed the Corsi Block Task and Digit Span Task at pre- and post-training. The experimental group showed significant improvements in their visuospatial and verbal WM compared to the control group. These findings support the brain's plasticity in the elderly. WM training for improving cognitive performance in older adults has potential and should be further investigated.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020, Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - BACKGROUND: People with Parkinson disease (PD) have difficulty initiating internally generated movements. We have shown that computer-based cognitive training can improve movement initiation. However, little is known about the optimal duration of training. <ovid:br/>OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the optimal training duration for computer-based neurorehabilitation of internally represented movement initiation in people with PD. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Nineteen PD and twenty-one age-matched control participants, ages 50-85 years, were included in analysis of pre- and post-training evaluation and 30 training sessions. Computer training consisted of cued and un-cued movement trials. The presentation of a cue (a combination of numbers on either the right, left or both sides of the screen) indicated that participants should respond by typing the numbers. Successful cued trials were followed by un-cued trials consisting of a green filled circle. Participants re-enter the cued sequence, thus producing an internally represented (IR) movement. The training was adaptive. Outcome measures were reaction time and error rate, and cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis was used to identify peak training improvement. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Participants with PD were divided into impaired (IPD) and unimpaired (UPD) groups, based on mean control group pre-training performance. All three groups showed improved RT and error rates for IR trials; however, the IPD group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in reaction time. Training was most effective in participants with greater disease severity and duration. Peak day of training improvement for the IPD group was 8 days. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Optimal training duration was relatively short and the IPD group demonstrated the most gain, indicating that cognitive training should be tailored to individual needs.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Background: Although the effects of various types of cognitive interventions have been evaluated, effectiveness and cost-saving effect of the combination of the different cognitive interventions is unknown. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial to assess the effectiveness of combined cognitive intervention. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A matched controlled trial of learning therapy (LT), a combination of cognitive training and stimulation, was conducted. The samples were recruited from the nursing homes. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age 65 years or older, clinical diagnosis of dementia, level of activities of daily living at II or above, Mini-Mental State Examination score between 10 and 26, receiving long-term-care services without history of LT, and provision of written consent. The primary outcomes were safety, validity of eligibility, retention rate, and effect on the functions of daily living represented by Criterion Time for Certification of Needed Long-Term-Care (CT for CNLTC) at 12 months. Cost-benefit analysis was also conducted to assess the cost saving effect of LT. <ovid:br/>Result(s): No serious adverse events were detected. The exclusion rate at the screening phase was 5% and the retention rate was 77% at 12 months. LT demonstrated statistically significant improvement in CT for CNLTC at 12 months (DELTA=18.8, almost equivalent to 'one' degree of the care needed level) and saved the long-term-care cost by JPY 200,000 (USD 1,618). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): LT is effective for improving care recipients' level of care needed and has a cost saving effect. A randomized controlled trial is required to verify these findings. Clinical Trial Registration: This study was approved by the ethics committee at Keio University School of Medicine (ID: 20150061). This trial was registered at University hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN-CTR ID: UMIN000018223).<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of combined scalp acupuncture and cognitive training on cognitive and motor functioning in patients with stroke during the recovery stage. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Seventy patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group. Patients in the experimental group additionally received scalp acupuncture and cognitive training, while the control group received sham scalp acupuncture and cognitive training. The cognitive and motor functioning of all patients were assessed using MMSE, LOTCA, and FMA, before and 12 weeks after treatment. In addition, the plasma BDNF and NGF levels were measured from peripheral blood samples using ELISA kits. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): After 12 weeks, the MMSE, LOTCA and FMA scores were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group. In the experimental group, there was an improvement in the total MMSE score, orientation, spatial executive function, the total LOTCA score, and the score of command of language orientation post-treatment. Significant improvements of BDNF and NGF were found in the experimental group after treatment, while only significant improvements of NGF was found in the control group after treatment. Both BDNF and NGF in the experiment group were higher than those in the control group at the last day of treatment. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Combined scalp acupuncture and cognitive training can efficiently enhance cognitive and motor functions in patients with stroke during the recovery stage, which may be a more effective rehabilitation treatment after stroke than routine therapy and rehabilitation training alone.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Objective: To explore the influence of continuous nursing based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model on life quality and inflammatory factors in patients who undergo thrombolysis after stroke. <ovid:br/>Method(s): One hundred patients after thrombolysis of stroke were used as research subjects. All subjects were randomly divided into a control group or observation group on the basis of a digital table. The control group received routine care and the observation group had additional IMB model-based continuous nursing combined with the routine care. Patients' quality of life was assessed according to the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment instrument. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to analyze the value of the contents of cytokines including S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), high-sensitive C reaction protein (hs CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Neural function was assessed by adopting the National institute of health stroke scale (NIHSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (MRS). Cognitive function of patients was estimated using Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Patients' psychological status was appraised using a Self-rating anxiety scale and Self-rating Depression Scale. Patients' satisfaction and disease recurrence were followed up and statistically analyzed. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Due to various factors during the study, the number of patients in the control group decreased by 10 and the observation group decreased by 11. Thus, the final number of subjects in the observation group and the control group was 39 and 40, respectively. Decreased NIHSS and MRS scores and significantly elevated MMSE and MOCA scores were all found in the two groups. However, the NIHSS and MRS scores of the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group, while the MMSE and MOCA scores were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). Intervention measures used in our study significantly elevated the scores of physiology, psychology, independence, social relations, surroundings and consciousness, and the scores of the above indicators in the observation group were all significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). Besides, the levels of S100B, NSE, hs CRP and TNF-alpha in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). What is more, the satisfaction rate of patients in the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Continuous nursing interventions based on the IMB model significantly improve the quality of life and cognitive rehabilitation of patients after thrombolysis of stroke, and reduces the level of inflammatory factors, which is worthy of clinical promotion.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

N2  - Introduction: This clinical trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of a 6-week course of daily neuroADTM therapy. <ovid:br/>Method(s): 131 subjects between 60 and 90 years old, unmedicated for Alzheimer's disease (AD), or on stable doses of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine, with Mini-Mental State Examination scores between 18 and 26, clinical dementia rating scale scores of 1 or 2, enrolled for a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, multicenter clinical trial. Structural brain MRIs were obtained for transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting. Baseline Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive (ADAS-Cog) and Clinical Global Impression of Change were assessed. 129 participants were randomized to active treatment plus standard of care (SOC) or sham treatments plus SOC. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Subjects with baseline ADAS-Cog <= 30 (~85% of study population) showed a statistically significant benefit favoring active over sham. Responder analysis showed 31.7% participants in the active group with <= -4 point improvement on ADAS-Cog versus 15.4% in the sham group. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): neuroADTM Therapy System provides a low-risk therapeutic benefit for patients with milder AD (baseline ADAS-Cog <=30) beyond pharmacologic SOC.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 the Alzheimer's Association

N2  - Objective: We examined the benefits of a community-based program combining physical exercise, cognitive training, and education on dementia and lifestyle habits. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This crossover open-label trial included 141 community-dwelling elderly people with suspected mild cognitive decline (MCD). Subjects were assigned to a 6-month intervention-first/6-month observation-second (INT-OBS) group or an OBS-INT group. The 6-month intervention consisted of 2 h of physical exercise, cognitive training, and classroom study or rest once weekly. Primary outcome was change in Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale (TDAS) score. <ovid:br/>Result(s): TDAS score improved significantly during the intervention period compared with the observation period for all subjects (P < 0.05). Some physical functions also improved significantly during the intervention period compared with the observation period in the OBS-INT group (P < 0.05). <ovid:br/>Interpretation(s): This community-based program improved both cognitive and physical function in elderly people with suspected MCD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Background and Purpose The prevalence of dementia is increasing in South Korea. Multidomain interventions may be useful for preventing dementia. Such programs need to be disseminated to elderly Koreans throughout the country. We have developed programs of the SoUth Korean study to PrEvent cognitive impaiRment and protect BRAIN health through lifestyle intervention in at-risk elderly people (SUPERBRAIN), which consists of a facility-based multidomain intervention (FMI) program and a home-based multidomain intervention (HMI) program suitable for elderly Koreans. We aim to determine the feasibility of the SUPERBRAIN programs before a large-scale randomized controlled trial. Methods We will recruit 150 participants among those without dementia aged 60-79 years with at least 1 modifiable dementia risk factor. They will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to the FMI, HMI, and the waiting-list control arm. The 6-month multidomain intervention consists of management of metabolic and vascular risk factors, cognitive training and social activity, physical exercise, nutritional guidance, and motivational enhancement programs. The primary outcomes are adherence and retention rates and changes in the total scale index score of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status from baseline to the study end. The main secondary outcomes are disability, depressive symptoms, quality of life, vascular risk factors, physical performance, nutritional assessment, and motivation questionnaire. There will be an exploratory evaluation of neurotrophic, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation factors, microbiome, telomere length, electroencephalography, and neuroimaging measures. Conclusions The results obtained will provide information on the applicability of these multidomain intervention programs to at-risk elderly people.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Korean Neurological Association.

N2  - Background and Purpose A cognitive intervention (CI) is thought to improve cognition and delay cognitive decline via neuronal plasticity and cognitive resilience. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) might be the first symptomatic stage of Alzheimer's disease, but few studies have examined the beneficial effect of CIs in SCD. We aimed to determine the efficacy of a 12-week, small-group-based, multidomain CI in elderly patients with SCD. Methods Participants diagnosed with SCD (aged 55-75 years) were consecutively allocated to three groups: group 1, which received group-based CI implementation with lifestyle modifications; group 2, which received home-based lifestyle modifications without CI; and group 3, in which no action was taken. The primary outcome variables were the scores on computerized tests of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). The secondary outcomes included scores on tests evaluating general cognition, memory, visuospatial, and executive functions, as well as scores for the quality of life (QoL), anxiety, depression, and degree of subjective complaints. Changes in scores during the study period were compared between groups. Results The study was completed by 56 SCD participants. The baseline characteristics did not differ among the groups. The primary outcomes (CANTAB scores) did not differ among the groups. However, the outcomes for phonemic word fluency, verbal memory, QoL, and mood were better for group 1 than for the other two groups. Improvements in verbal memory function and executive function were related to the baseline cognitive scores and group differences. Conclusions CI in SCD seems to be partially beneficial for executive function, memory, QoL, and mood, suggesting that CI is a useful nonpharmacological treatment option in this population.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Korean Neurological Association.

N2  - Background: Older adults, especially those above age 80, are the fastest growing segment of the population in the United States and at risk for age-related cognitive decline and dementia. There is growing evidence that cognitive activity and training may allow adults to maintain or improve cognitive functioning, but little is known about the potential benefit in the oldest old. In this randomized trial, the effectiveness of a computerized cognitive training program (CCT program) was compared to an active control games program to improve cognition in cognitively normal individuals aged 80 and older. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Sixty-nine older adults were randomized to a 24-session CCT program (n = 39) or an active control program (n = 30). Participants completed a pre- and post- training neuropsychological assessment. The primary outcome measure was a global cognitive composite, and the secondary outcomes were the scores on specific cognitive domains (of memory, executive function/attention, and language). <ovid:br/>Result(s): Using linear mixed models, there were no significant differences between the CCT and the active control program on the primary (p = 0.662) or any of the secondary outcomes (language functioning, p =.628; attention/executive functioning, p =.428; memory, p =.749). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study suggests that short-term CCT had no specific benefit for cognitive functioning in non-demented individuals aged 80 and older.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; International Psychogeriatric Association 2019.

N2  - Introduction: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) and Cognitive Training (CT) are the gold-standard pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for mild to moderate dementia [1]. The present study aims to investigate the effect of each treatment, alone or combined, on neuropsychological profile of patients with mild dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Forty participants, enrolled on clinical (geriatric assessment) and morphological (CT/RMN) assessments, were assigned to three groups receiving, respectively, only the pharmacological treatment (AChEI, n = 14), both the treatments (AChEI + CT, n = 15), or only the cognitive training (CT, n = 11). Cognitive profile was evaluated, at the baseline and after three months, by the MMSE [3], and an extended neuropsychological battery of tests, the Brief Neuropsychological Examination-2 [4]. To evidence differences among the treatments, in terms of changes in the patients' neuropsychological profile, linear mixed models were conducted. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A general improvement at the MMSE emerged only in patients which received AChEI + CT, and CT, compared to the group that received only AChEI. Interestingly, after the intervention, individuals receiving the CT showed a significant improvement in immediate memory recall with respect to the AChEI group. In addition, only the group receiving both the treatments (AChEI + CT) showed an improvement in delayed recall after the intervention, compared to the other groups. Key conclusions: The combination of AChEI and CT seems to bring the greatest benefit for persons with mild dementia. More interestingly, CT is more effective than AChEI alone even in improving memory, which classically is considered as the lost cognitive domain.

N2  - Background: Stroke is the second leading cause of vascular dementia. Assessing meaningful changes in cognitive function from clinical trials is critical for clinical management. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for the Alzheimeras Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Plus (ADAS-Cog-Plus) tool are not established. The purpose of this study was to establish MCIDs for the ADAS-Cog-Plus in chronic stroke survivors at the 1-year follow-up after receiving 6 months of exercise (EX) or cognitive training (COG) relative to balance and tone (CON). <ovid:br/>Method(s): A complete case analysis of cognitive outcomes (i.e., ADAS-Cog-Plus, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)) acquired at baseline and 1-year from participants receiving EX (n=25/34; Age:68.2+/-8.6 years; 44.0% Female), COG (n=28/34; Age:70.2+/-9.0 years; 35.7% Female), or CON (n=43/52; Age:69.6+/-7.3 years; 44.2% Female) was used to establish the MCID for the ADAS-Cog-Plus, using distribution- A nd anchor-based approaches. The distributionbased approach accounted for variability at baseline and follow-up and used a standardized effect size of 0.5. The MOCA (a12 points) and MMSE (a12 points) were used as anchors given their relevance and relationship with the ADAS-Cog-Plus. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was used to indicate the accuracy to discriminate between meaningful from no meaningful improvements. The change difference (1 year minus baseline) on the ADAS-Cog-Plus observed in participants with meaningful improvements in the anchor receiving an intervention was subtracted from the change difference of the CON group. Change differences were calculated for both anchors, between both intervention groups and CON group. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The distribution-based MCID for the ADAS-Cog-Plus in the EX and COG groups were:-0.394 and-0.368, respectively. Improvements on the ADAS-CogPlus (i.e., lower scores) of a-0.325 to-0.394 points are meaningful in stroke survivors 6 months after EX (MOCAa12: AUC=0.736, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) MCID=-0.326, change difference MCID=-0.325; MMSEa12: AUC=0.746, ROC MCID=-0.326; change difference MCID=-0.393). Poor discrimination accuracy was observed in the COG group (MOCAa12 AUC=0.525; MMSEa12 AUC=0.504), thus the MCID was not established. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These MCIDs are important for researchers and clinicians to critically apprise improvements in the ADAS-Cog-Plus following EX, policy-makers in economic evaluations, and stroke survivors to receive best practice care.

N2  - Introduction It's been proved that cognitive stimulation has direct effects over the improvement of general cognitive functions in people with cognitive impairment. People older than 50 are progressively familiar with computers and mobile devices, opening an opportunity for computer based online cognitive stimulation programmes. Objectives To compare the efficacy of face to face cognitive stimulation (FFCS) with online home delivered cognitive stimulation (OCS) regarding adherence, number of sessions, cognitive function and mood. Patients and Methods Participants were enrolled in a public memory clinic; 51 patients with cognitive decline were assigned to two groups: 27 received FFCS in a group format and 24 received OCS with the assistance of a carer. Both face to face and online interventions where designed and supervised by a trained Occupational Therapist. Pre and post assessments were carried out by a Clinical Psychologist with the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), the clock test, and the brief Geriatric Depression Scale. No differences were found between groups in age (69.65+/-9.74 years), cognitive function (MMSE=24.63+/-3.67), gender (55% women) and education. The treatment consisted of 32 sessions of CS held twice a week during 4 months. Results Data was analysed with nonparametric statistics and between group effect sizes were calculated. The FFCS participants completed 29.19 +/- 1.73 sessions while the OCS group completed 26.00 +/- 10.64 sessions (p < .000). All the participants in the FFCS group (100%) and 14 of the OCS group (58%) finished the treatment (p < .000). Between group effect size favoured the FFCS intervention for MMSE (dc = 0.36). No between group differences were found for mood (dc =-0.5) or the clock test (dc = 0.13). Conclusions FFCS is better accepted by patients than OCS, with higher rates of adherence and less dropouts. FFCS leads to better results in the preservation of cognitive capacity.

N2  - Background and aims: The incidence of stroke varies from country to country. In Romania, there are approximately 300 new cases/100,000 inhabitants, compared to a European average of almost 200 strokes/100,000 inhabitants. 20% of those who survive have a continuous cognitive deterioration. Prevalence of dementia highest in months following stroke (3%/year) being bigger than without stroke. Age, education or cardiovascular factors can be risk post-stroke cognitive impairment Methods: 1 year retrospective study in 220 in-patients after 6 months from stroke; 64% men; mean age 70.58y+/-10.504, from Sf. Luca Geriatrics Hospital, Bucharest. We assessed: incidence of stroke by age, education; incidence of vascular factors (hypertension, atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia); functional capacity using the standardized daily instrumental activity (IADL) scale; cognitive disorder using standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Geriatric Depression (GDS) Scales. Descriptive analysis by SPSS 12 statistical tools. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 90.90% had high degree of disability by IADLscale; 82% have moderate cognitive dysfunction by MMSE (10-20 points); 84% have depressive disorder by GDS (7-15 points). Relationship of risk post-stroke cognitive impairment by age: 74.54% patients were in old age group (76-85y) (p<0.003), from which 61% are men; education: 59% of patients had elementary studies (p<0.005); vascular factors:recurrent stroke (31.81%) (p<0.001), hypertension and dyslipidemia (22.72%) (p<0.006), atrial fibrillation (15.90%) (p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (9.09%) (p<0.124). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The most vulnerable patients for dementia post stroke are elderly more 75 years old, men prevalent, with low level of education and with several vascular risk factors. A management of cognitive disorders post stroke is focused on prevention: cognitive training and monitoring risk factors. Brain reserve can protect against cognitive deterioration by leisure activities, social interactions and education, before early 60th ages.

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of creative expression (CE) therapy on cognition, communication, emotion, and quality-of-life in people with dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): One hundred individuals were included in this study, of whom 91 completed the study (mean age=84.33). The participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=43) and a control group (n=48), and received the CE program or standard cognitive (SC) training twice a week for 6 weeks, respectively. Both groups were submitted to extensive neuropsychological tests, as follows - Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD), Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Functional Assessment of Communication Skills (FACS) at baseline, 1-, and 4-weeks post-intervention, and the Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) was measured during the intervention period at weeks 3 and 6. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The participants demonstrated significant improvements in cognitive function, quality-of-life, depression degree, communication ability, and emotion status (P<0.05) at post-intervention, which were maintained at 1-month follow-up. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study provides preliminary evidence that CE therapy developed in the study benefits elderly Chinese with dementia. The findings indicated that non-pharmacological intervention programs - CE therapy - can be applied in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Lin et al.

N2  - Background and aim: Given the ever-increasing of the older adults population and in order to achieve healthy and active ageing goals and improvement in the cognitive function and sleep quality in older adult, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of cognitive training program on improving cognitive function and ageing-related sleep quality in community-dwelling elderly in Iran, in 2018. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This was an experimental study. The sample comprised 420 older adults who were a member of the comprehensive health center in one of the southern cities of Iran. 164 had a cognitive problem and sleep disorder, of whom 108 were selected by the available method and based on inclusion criteria. Participants were randomly allocated to an experimental group (n=54) and a control group (n=54). Experimental group samples were undergoing the intervention for two months. Data were collected using MMSE questionnaire, Pittsburgh sleep quality, insomnia severity index and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR). Data were collected one month before-and-after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There was no significant difference between the mean score of cognitive function and sleep quality in both the intervention group and the control group before the intervention (p>0.05). At the post-test, the mean (SD) of elderly adults' cognitive function in the intervention and control groups were 2.7 (1.3) and 3.44 (1.7), respectively (p=0.017). Moreover, the mean (SD) of sleep quality in older adults in the intervention and the control group was 6.76 (2.3) and 9.25 (2.36), respectively (p<0.001). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Given the obtained results in the current study the cognitive training promotes cognitive function and sleep quality in older adults. Therefore, since this program is effective, low-cost and applicable, it can be used to improve cognitive function and sleep disorder in the older adult population.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Brazilian Association of Sleep and Latin American Federation of Sleep Societies.

N2  - Various studies report discordant results regarding the efficacy, parameters, and underlying mechanisms of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with cognitive training (CT) on Alzheimer's disease (AD). The objective of the study was to assess the effect of rTMS-CT on cognition, the activities of daily life, neuropsychiatric behavioral symptoms, and metabolite levels beneath the stimulated areas of the brain in patients with AD and to investigate the correlation of metabolic changes (measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy [<ovid:sup>1</ovid:sup>H-MRS]) with clinical outcomes after treatment. Thirty consecutive patients with mild or moderate AD were enrolled and randomly divided into one of the two intervention groups: (1) real rTMS with CT (i.e., real group) and (2) sham rTMS with CT (i.e., sham group). 10 Hz rTMS was used to stimulate the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and then to stimulate the left lateral temporal lobe (LTL) for 20 min each day for 4 weeks. Each patient underwent neuropsychological assessment at baseline (T0), immediately after treatment (T1), and 4 weeks after treatment (T2). The ratios of N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr), myoinositol/creatine (mI/Cr), and choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) in the stimulated cortex were measured using <ovid:sup>1</ovid:sup>H-MRS at T0 and T1. Twenty-eight patients were treated with rTMS-CT for 4 weeks. Two patients in the sham group withdrew after being treated several times. Compared with the sham group, the cognitive function and behavior in the real rTMS group improved significantly at T1 and T2. In the real group, compared with the sham group, the NAA/Cr ratio in the left DLPFC was significantly elevated (p = 0.045); however, in the left LTL, it only showed a tendency toward increase (p = 0.162). The change in the NAA/Cr ratio in the left DLPFC was negatively correlated with the change in the cognitive scales of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). This study indicated a possible modest effect of rTMS-CT on preventing clinical and neuronal functional deterioration in the left DLPFC of patients with AD. The left DLPFC is a better candidate area than the left LTL.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Purpose: This study compared the effects of a combination of soy peptide supplementation and exercise with those of exercise only, on the cognitive function of elderly adults. <ovid:br/>Patients and Methods: This randomized, non-blinded, controlled clinical trial included 67 participants aged 60 years or more with non-cognitive dysfunction who were divided into two groups according to the intervention method: an exercise group (Ex group, n = 36) and an exercise plus nutrition group (Ex+Nt group, n = 31). The Ex group completed a memory training activity for 15 mins and aerobic exercise for 45 mins once a week for 90 days. The Ex+Nt group completed the same training plus received soy peptide for 90 days. The Mini-Mental Status Examination score, trail-making test A/B score, skeletal muscle mass index, grip strength, gait speed, and geriatric depression scale were measured at baseline and post intervention. For comparison between the pretest and posttest measurements to determine the intervention effects, a two-way analysis of variance was performed. The significance level was set at < 5%. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A two-way analysis of variance revealed significant time effects on trail-making test-A score, skeletal muscle index, grip strength, and gait speed in both groups. There were significant time x group interactions for greater increase in calculation score. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): A combination of exercise and soy peptide supplementation was effective in improving a portion of cognitive function.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Imaoka et al.

N2  - Introduction Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common in older adults and represents a high-risk group for progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Medication trials in MCI have generally failed, but new discoveries with brain plasticity in ageing have led to the study of cognitive training as a potential treatment to improve cognitive abilities. Computerised cognitive training (CCT) involves computerised cognitive exercises that target specific cognitive abilities and neural networks to potentially improve cognitive functioning through neuroplasticity. Methods and analysis In a two-site study (New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University Medical Center and Duke University Medical Center), we will randomise 100 patients with MCI (Wechsler Memory Scale-III Logical Memory II score 0-11; Folstein Mini Mental State Examination >=23) to home-based CCT (suite of exercises: memory, matching, spatial recognition, processing speed) or a home-based active control condition (computerised crossword puzzle training (CPT)) with 12 weeks of intensive training followed by regular booster sessions up to 78 weeks. All patients will receive standard neuropsychological and functional assessments in clinic as well as structural/functional brain MRI scans at study entry and endpoint. We will test if CCT, versus CPT, leads to improved cognitive functioning, transfers to functional ability and tasks of everyday life and impacts hippocampal volume changes and changes in the default mode network of the brain measured by resting-state functional MRI. Ethics and dissemination The study will be conducted following ethics approval and written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects. Study results will be disseminated via publication, clinicaltrials.gov, media and conference presentations. This will be the first controlled long-term trial to evaluate the effects of home-based CCT versus computerised CPT on cognitive abilities and functional measures and neural outcomes as determined by MRI indices in patients with MCI. Positive results from trial may support further development of home-based CCT. Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT03205709).<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

N2  - Background: Mood disorder after stroke is common but drug and psychosocial treatments have been assessed with disappointing results. Preventing mood disorder from developing in the first place could be a better approach and might reduce the need for pharmacotherapy in this predominantly older patient group. We used a brief problem-solving therapy and evaluated its effect in reducing mood disorder in the 12 months after stroke. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A 3-group, parallel, randomised controlled trial. Four hundred fifty patients with stroke were randomised within 1 month of hospital admission to problem-solving therapy from a psychiatric nurse, non-specific support given by volunteers or treatment-as-usual. Follow up took place at 6 and 12 months after stroke. Standardised measures of mood (Present State Examination, GHQ-28), cognitive state (mini-mental state examination) and function (Barthel ADL index, Frenchay Activities Index) were taken at baseline, 6 and 12 months after randomisation. Satisfaction with care was recorded at follow up. <ovid:br/>Result(s): At 6 months, all psychological and activity measures favoured problem-solving therapy. At 12 months, patients in the problem-solving therapy group had significantly lower GHQ-28 scores and lower median Present State Examination symptom scores. There were no statistically significant differences in activity. The problem-solving therapy group were more satisfied with some aspects of care. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results are encouraging and suggest it is possible to prevent mood disorder in stroke patients using a psychological intervention. The differences between the groups at 12 months may indicate a sustained impact of psychological therapies, by comparison with non-specific support.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a 2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention on daily functioning of older people. DESIGN: A 2-year randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01041989). SETTING: Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1260 older adults, with a mean age of 69 years at the baseline, who were at risk of cognitive decline. INTERVENTION: A multidomain intervention, including simultaneous physical activity intervention, nutritional counseling, vascular risk monitoring and management, and cognitive training and social activity. MEASUREMENTS: The ability to perform daily activities (activities of daily living [ADLs] and instrumental ADLs) and physical performance (Short Physical Performance Battery). <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The mean baseline ADL score was 18.1 (SD = 2.6) points; the scale ranges from 17 (no difficulties) to 85 (total ADL dependence). During the 2-year intervention, the ADL disability score slightly increased in the control group, while in the intervention group, it remained relatively stable. Based on the latent growth curve model, the difference in the change between the intervention and control groups was -0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.61 to -0.28) after 1 year and -1.20 (95% CI = -2.02 to -0.38) after 2 years. In terms of physical performance, the intervention group had a slightly higher probability of improvement (from score 3 to score 4; P =.041) and a lower probability of decline (from score 3 to scores 0-2; P =.043) for chair rise compared to the control group. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): A 2-year lifestyle intervention was able to maintain the daily functioning of the at-risk older population. The clinical significance of these results in this fairly well-functioning population remains uncertain, but the study results hold promise that healthy eating, exercise, and cognitive and social activity may have favorable effects on functional independence in older people.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The American Geriatrics Society

N2  - The objective of this study is to assess and compare the effect of applying a computerised cognitive training programme and virtual environment rehabilitation system on cognitive functions in patients after a stroke. Methods. A controlled trial included 121 persons referred to second stage rehabilitation. The subjects were differentiated into three impact groups by a single blinded trial. Results. The trial revealed that cognitive functions improved in all patient groups (p<0.001). A paired comparison analysis of all groups demonstrated a tendency for cognitive functions, evaluated by the MoCA-LT test, to be more strongly improved in patients who practised a computerised cognitive training programme during their OT sessions than those who did not (p=0.054). Conclusions. The final outcome of the trial was that cognitive functions significantly improved in patients who practised computerised cognitive training programmes or virtual environment rehabilitation systems, compared to those participants who only had occupational therapy sessions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Daiva Baltaduoniene, et al. published by De Gruyter.

N2  - Objectives: To determine whether individual goal-oriented cognitive rehabilitation (CR) improves everyday functioning for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. Design and methods: Parallel group multicentre single-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing CR added to usual treatment (CR) with usual treatment alone (TAU) for people with an ICD-10 diagnosis of Alzheimer, vascular or mixed dementia, and mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score >= 18), and with a family member willing to contribute. Participants allocated to CR received 10 weekly sessions over 3 months and four maintenance sessions over 6 months. Participants were followed up 3 and 9 months post randomisation by blinded researchers. The primary outcome was self-reported goal attainment at 3 months. Secondary outcomes at 3 and 9 months included informant-reported goal attainment, quality of life, mood, self-efficacy, and cognition and study partner stress and quality of life. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We randomised (1:1) 475 people with dementia; 445 (CR = 281) were included in the intention to treat analysis at 3 months and 426 (CR = 208) at 9 months. At 3 months, there were statistically significant large positive effects for participant-rated goal attainment (d = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.75-1.19), corroborated by informant ratings (d = 1.11; 95% CI, 0.89-1.34). These effects were maintained at 9 months for both participant (d = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.71-1.17) and informant (d = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.73-1.2) ratings. The observed gains related to goals directly targeted in the therapy. There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): CR enables people with early-stage dementia to improve their everyday functioning in relation to individual goals targeted in the therapy.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The Authors.

N2  - Background: Although cognitive training is effective for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), it is not clear which format is more effective. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To compare the effectiveness of the same language programs when carried out via computer, paper/pencil and orally in people with MCI. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Seventy-one participants with MCI were randomly classified in 3 experimental and 2 control groups. The experimental groups attended 48 sessions of language training for 6 months. The control groups attended either unstructured sessions or they were on waiting list. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Mixed measures analysis of variance, at the follow-up, showed a significant cognitive abilities improvement among the experimental versus control groups. At the end of the language training, the 3 groups presented improvement in cognitive abilities and daily function, while the control groups remained at the same performance level. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): All 3 cognitive language training methods were equally significantly effective.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Introduction: The benefit of cognitive rehabilitation (CR) for patients with early-stage Alzheimer disease (AD) remains difficult to assess. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An observational, prospective study was conducted in a sample of 52 patients with AD included in a clinical, individualized CR program. Cognitive rehabilitation consisted of 1 weekly session during 3 months at home, followed by 1 monthly contact for 9 months. Rehabilitation techniques were used by experienced therapists to adapt activities important for the patient. Evaluation of patient's dependence in activities and objective and subjective caregiver's burden was performed with a research quantitative scale immediately after the intervention and at 6-month and 1-year follow-up. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Analyses with repeated measure analysis of variance showed decreased patient's dependence for adapted activities at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Objective and subjective percentage of caregiver's burden was also decreased at all evaluations with our research functional scale, while there was no change on Zarit's burden scale. Global cognition slightly decreased over 1 year. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This observational study in a clinical setting is in line with the benefit of CR for patients with mild AD reported in recent randomized controlled trials. The benefit obtained for adapted activities remained after 1 year, even if global cognition declined. Moreover caregiver's burden related to all individually relevant daily activities (from a list of 98) evaluated within the CR program was decreased after 1 year. Those preliminary results emphasize the importance of choice for the measurement instrument to report CR efficacy and claim for further validation of such tools.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Background: Computerized multi-model training has been widely studied for its effect on delaying cognitive decline. In this study, we designed the first Chinese-version computer-based multi-model cognitive training for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Neuropsychological effects and neural activity changes assessed by functional MRI were both evaluated. <ovid:br/>Method(s): MCI patients in the training group were asked to take training 3-4 times per week for 6 months. Neuropsychological and resting-state fMRI assessment were performed at baseline and at 6 months. Patients in both groups were continuously followed up for another 12 months and assessed by neuropsychological tests again. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 78 patients in the training group and 63 patients in the control group accomplished 6-month follow-up. Training group improved 0.23 standard deviation (SD) of mini-mental state examination, while control group had 0.5 SD decline. Addenbrooke's cognitive examination-revised scores in attention (p = 0.002) and memory (p = 0.006), as well as stroop color-word test interference index (p = 0.038) and complex figure test-copy score (p = 0.035) were also in favor of the training effect. Difference between the changes of two groups after training was not statistically significant. The fMRI showed increased regional activity at bilateral temporal poles, insular cortices and hippocampus. However, difference between the changes of two groups after another 12 months was not statistically significant. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Multi-model cognitive training help MCI patients to gained cognition benefit, especially in memory, attention and executive function. Functional neuroimaging provided consistent neural activation evidence. Nevertheless, after one-year follow up after last training, training effects were not significant. The study provided new evidence of beneficial effect of multi-model cognitive training.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019

N2  - Aim: To assess the impact of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) on cognition, quality of life, and mood in Taiwanese elders with cognitive impairment attending a day care center. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Twenty-five adults aged 65 years and older were assigned into the CST (n =12) and control (n = 13) groups. Weekly 90-minute CST sessions for 14 weeks were conducted by occupational therapists and occupational therapist students. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were used for pre-and posttest measurements. Within-and between-group comparisons of test scores were performed. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Significant between-group differences were found for the ADAS-Cog change scores. Specifically, there was significant cognitive improvement for participants in CST group at posttest, with no observable change for the controls. No significant pre-/postgains were noted in the QoL-AD and HADS scores for the 2 groups. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The once-a-week CST approach seems to be a viable alternative to twice-a-week CST for community-dwelling older adults with mild to moderate cognitive deficits. Further investigation is required to determine the optimal dose of CST for the elderly.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives: People with dementia are known to be physically frailer, more sedentary, and participate less in regular physical exercise compared to their healthy peers. Physical activity interventions have the potential to reduce the level of frailty in community-dwelling older adults. Exergaming combines physical exercise with cognitive stimulation in a virtual environment. It is an innovative and fun way of exercising, which may aid people with dementia to be more physically active. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a 12-week exergame training and equally long aerobic training, both compared to an active control group, on frailty in people with dementia. <ovid:br/>Design(s): A 3-armed randomized controlled trial compared exergame training, aerobic training, and an active control intervention. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): 115 people with dementia [mean (standard deviation [SD]) age = 79.2 (6.9) years; mean (SD) Mini-Mental State Examination score = 22.9 (3.4)]. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Participants were randomized and individually trained 3 times a week during 12 weeks. The Evaluative Frailty Index for Physical activity (EFIP) was used to assess the level of frailty at baseline and after the 12-week intervention period. Between-group differences were analyzed with analysis of covariance. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The exergame group showed a trend toward higher adherence compared to the aerobic group (87.3% vs 81.1%, P = .05). A significant reduction on the EFIP was found in the exergame group (EG) compared to the active control group (CG) [mean difference (95% confidence interval) between EG and CG: -0.034 [-0.062, -0.007], P = .012], with a small-to-moderate effect size (partial eta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.055). Conclusions and implications: This is the first study to show that a 12-week exergame intervention reduces the level of frailty in people with dementia. This is an important and promising result, because frailty is a powerful predictor for adverse health outcomes, and its reduction may have positive effects on health status. Moreover, exergaming resulted in high adherence rates of physical exercise, which makes it an effective strategy to engage people with dementia in physical activity.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019

N2  - Previous studies have indicated that an active lifestyle is associated with better brain health and a longer life, compared to a more sedentary lifestyle. These studies, both on human and animal subjects, have typically focused on a single activity, usually physical exercise, but other activities have received an increasing interest. One proposed mechanism is that physical exercise increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain. For the first time, the long-term effects on serum BDNF levels were compared in persons who engaged in either physical exercise training, cognitive training, or mindfulness practice during 5 weeks, and compared with an active control group. Two cohorts of healthy older individuals, one from the Boston area in the US and one from the Vaxjo area in Sweden, participated. A total of 146 participants were randomly assigned to one of the four groups. All interventions were structurally similar, using interactive, computer-based software that directed participants to carry out specified activities for 35 minutes/day, 5 days per week for 5 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and soon after the completion of the 5-week long intervention program, and serum BDNF levels were measured using a commercially available ELISA. Only the group that underwent cognitive training increased their serum BDNF levels after 5 weeks of training (F1,74=4.22, p=0.044, partial eta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup>=0.054), corresponding to an average 10% increase. These results strongly suggest that cognitive training can exert beneficial effects on brain health in an older adult population.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Introduction: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a potentially novel strategy for cognitive enhancement in patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorders. This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of tDCS during cognitive training on cognitive functioning in patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorders. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This study was primarily a single arm for safety, secondary a two-arm, parallel, randomized, and sham-controlled trial for potential efficacy. Patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorders were recruited. The participants and raters were blinded to the group assignment. The participants in the active arm received tDCS (anodal; F3, cathodal, Fp2, 2A, 20 min) twice daily for five consecutive days, whereas those in the sham arm received the same amount of sham-tDCS. Calculation and reading tasks were conducted in both arms as a form of cognitive intervention for 20 min during tDCS. The primary outcome was the attrition rate during the trial in the active arm, which is expected to be less than 10%. The secondary outcomes were the between-group differences of adjusted means for several cognitive scales from baseline to post-intervention and follow-up. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Twenty patients [nine women (45%)], with a mean (standard deviation) age of 76.1 years participated; nine patients (45%) with minor neurocognitive disorders and 11 (55%) with major neurocognitive disorders were randomized, and 19 of them completed the trial. The attrition rate in the active arm was 0%, with no serious adverse events. Further, in the Intention-to-Treat analysis, patients in the active arm showed no statistically significant improvement compared with those who received the sham in the mean change scores of the mini-mental state examination [0.41; 95% CI (-1.85; 2.67) at day five, 1.08; 95% CI (-1.31; 3.46) at follow-up] and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale - cognition subscale [1.61; 95% CI (-4.2; 0.98) at day 5, 0.36; 95%CI (-3.19; 2.47) at follow-up]. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that tDCS is safe and tolerable but causes no statistically significant cognitive effects in patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorders. Additional large-scale, well-designed clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the cognitive effects of tDCS as an augmentation to cognitive training.

N2  - Background: Multicomponent non-pharmacological therapies have been shown to be effective at reducing cognitive symptoms and slowing deterioration in abilities to perform activities of daily living (ADL) in individuals with cognitive impairment. However, little is known about response rates and predictors of response. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We used data from the German day-care study (DeTaMAKS; De = dementia, Ta = Tagespflege/day-care, M = motor stimulation, A = activities of daily living stimulation, K = k/cognitive stimulation, S = social stimulation; n = 362), which was based on a cluster-randomized trial of the non-pharmacological, multicomponent, anti-dementia MAKS therapy for people with cognitive impairment in day-care centers. We investigated response (defined as improvement or no deterioration) for three different response criteria: cognition via Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, ADL via Erlangen Test of Activities of Daily Living in Persons with Mild Dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (ETAM) score, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) via Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) score. In addition, we calculated the number needed to treat (NTT) and response rates according to net gain analyses. <ovid:br/>Result(s): For all three criteria, the response rates were higher in the intervention group than in the control group (chi<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> test: p = 0.058 to p = 0.003). Compared with non-responders, responders according to cognition had higher ETAM scores (= better ADL abilities) at baseline; responders according to ADL had lower ETAM scores (= poorer ADL abilities) at baseline; and responders according to BPSD had higher NPI-Q scores (= more BPSD) at baseline. Classification rates based on these predictors ranged from 60.6 to 68.3%. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): The response rates to the non-pharmacological MAKS therapy were greater than those reported for anti-dementia drugs. There were only a few differences between responders and non-responders. Because of the low classification rates, these variables had only a small impact on response predictions. Therefore, there are no empirically substantiated selection criteria for the application of MAKS therapy in facilities.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is no successful pharmacological treatment for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's Disease, therefore treatments capable of slowing down the progression of cognitive dysfunction are needed. <ovid:br/>OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive training, supported by the CoRe computerized tool, in patients with Parkinson's Disease Mild Cognitive Impairment. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): This is a prospective, open-unblinded, randomized, controlled study. After baseline cognitive assessment (T0), enrolled patients were randomized to receive motor rehabilitation plus cognitive intervention (G1) or motor rehabilitation only (G2). Follow-up assessments were scheduled 4 weeks (T1) and 6 months after (T2). Global cognitive functioning scores (MOCA and MMSE) were considered as primary outcome. Outcome measures at T0, T1 and T2 were compared within-and between-groups. A percentage change score between T0 and next assessments was calculated to identify patients who improved, remain stable or worsened. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Differently from G2, G1 showed a medium/large effect size improvement in primary (MoCA) and secondary outcome, both between T0 and T1 and T0 and T2. Moreover, within G1, most patients improved their cognitive state compared to the baseline. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Patients trained with CoRe showed a better evolution of cognitive decline, while untreated patients tended to get worse over time.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019-IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Background/Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dual-task training with different intensity of aerobic exercise on cognitive function (MMSE-K, Trail making test, and Stroop test) and neurotrophic factors (BDNF, IGF-1) in chronic stroke patients. Methods / Statistical analysis: The subjects were 27 stroke patients who met the study selection criteria, and were divided according to screening tests into the following: group I (low-intensity aerobic exercise plus dual-task training, n=9), group II (moderate-intensity aerobic exercise plus dual-task training, n=9), and group III (high-moderate-intensity aerobic exercise plus dual-task training, n=9). Subjects performed training 5 times a week, a total of 30 times in 6 weeks. <ovid:br/>Finding(s): The results of the study showed that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (p<.01) and high-intensity aerobic exercise (p<.001) showed significant differences between after training (p<.001). Significant differences between the groups were found after training, with a difference in MMSE-K between group I and III (p<.001) and between group II and III (p<.01). A significant difference was found between the groups in the Trail Making Test and the Stroop test (p<.001), with a difference after training between group I and III (p<.001) and between group II and III (p<.01). In addition, a significant difference was found between the groups in BDNF and IGF-1 levels (p<.001), with a difference between group I and III (p<.001) and between group II and III (p<.05). Improvements/Applications: Therefore, the present study found that the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for stroke patients can be enhanced by using differentiated aerobic exercise rather than limited desktop activity.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; RJPT All right reserved.

N2  - Background: Walking while performing cognitive and motor tasks simultaneously interferes with gait performance and may lead to falls in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function [Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B], gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task costs (DTCs). Walking tasks were performed during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task). The GAIT Up system was used to evaluate gait parameters including speed, stride length, cadence and DTCs. DTC were defined as 100 * (single-task gait parameters - dual-task gait parameters)/single-task gait parameters. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Both groups showed significant improvements in the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed more improvements than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence with borderline significances. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): A 12-week VR-based physical and cognitive training program led to significant improvements in dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, which may be attributed to improvements in executive function.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Liao, Chen, Lin, Chen and Hsu.

N2  - Objective: We aimed to evaluate the influence of a novel designed intensive patient care program (IPCP) on cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression and relapse-free survival (RFS) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Two hundred forty-two AIS patients were consecutively recruited in this randomized controlled study and randomly allocated to IPCP group or control group as 1:1 ratio. Patients received IPCP and conventional treatment in IPCP group, while received usual education, cognitive rehabilitation training and conventional treatment in control group for 12-month intervention. Cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression were assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety (HADS-A), and HADS depression (HADS-D) at baseline (M0), month (M)3, M6 and M12. After intervention, patients were followed up until 2018/7/30 and RFS was calculated. <ovid:br/>Result(s): IPCP increased MMSE score at M12 and change of MMSE score (M12-M0), while decreased cognitive impairment rate at M12. For anxiety, decreased change of HADS-A score (M12-M0) and lower anxiety rate at M12 were observed in IPCP group compared to control group. For depression, decreased HADS-D score at M6 and M12, reduced change of HADS-D score (M12-M0) and lower depression rate at M12 were shown in IPCP group compared to control group. Besides, RFS was numerically longer in IPCP group compared to control group, but without statistical significance. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): IPCP presents with a positive influence on improving cognitive impairment and decreasing anxiety as well as depression, while a less effect on improving RFS in AIS patients. Abbreviation: IPCP: intensive patient care program; RFS: relapse free survival; AIS: acute ischemic stroke; MRA: magnetic resonance angiography; ITT: intention-to-treat; LOCF: last observation carried forward.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019, &#xa9; 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the associations of long-term lifestyle multidomain intervention (MI) and omega-3 supplementation with frailty level evolution and frailty incidence in community-dwelling older persons. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the randomized controlled Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial. SETTING: Thirteen memory centers in France and Monaco between 2008 and 2011. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1588 community-dwelling persons aged 70 years or older with memory complaints (without dementia), slow gait speed, or limitation in one instrumental activity of daily living. INTERVENTION: A 3-year MI (43 group sessions including cognitive training, physical activity, and nutrition advice and three preventive consultations) plus daily omega-3 fatty acids, MI plus placebo, omega-3 alone, or placebo alone. MEASUREMENTS: The frailty phenotype (unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, slow gait, low handgrip strength: 0 to 5 score, higher is worse; a score of 3 or higher defines frailty) was assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. We used mixed-effect models for frailty level (0-5 score as an ordinal variable) and Cox models for frailty incidence. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): No differences were found between the intervention groups and placebo on the 3-year evolution of frailty level. Among 1394 non-frail participants at baseline, frailty incidence occurred in 134 (9.6%) persons: 26 (7.6%) in the MI plus omega-3 group, 34 (10%) in the omega-3 alone group, 31 (8.5%) in the MI plus placebo group, and 43 (12.3%) in the placebo-alone group). No differences regarding frailty incidence were found between intervention groups and placebo. After exclusion of 53 participants with incident frailty during the first year of follow-up, MI plus omega-3 was associated with a lower frailty incidence compared with placebo (hazard ratio =.43; 95% confidence interval =.22-.81). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): In community-dwelling older persons, the combination of a long-term lifestyle MI and omega-3 supplementation did not reduce frailty level or incidence. The reduction of frailty incidence associated with the combined intervention in a sensitivity analysis needs to be further confirmed.

N2  - Background: The benefits of long-term omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (omega3-PUFA) supplementation on muscle strength in older adults remains to be investigated. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): We assessed the effect of omega3-PUFA supplementation and a multidomain (physical activity, cognitive training, and nutritional advice), alone or in combination, compared with placebo, on muscle strength. We also hypothesized that omega3-PUFA supplementation resulted in additional benefit in participants with a low docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) erythrocyte level at baseline and high adherence to the multidomain intervention sessions. <ovid:br/>Design(s): We performed secondary analyses of the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT), a 3-year, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with four parallel groups. Participants were non-demented, aged 70 years or older. They were recruited in 13 memory clinics in France and Monaco between 30 May 2008 and 24 February 2011. Participants were randomly assigned to either omega3-PUFA alone (two capsules a day providing a total daily dose of 800 mg DHA and 225 mg EPA), omega3-PUFA plus the multidomain intervention (43 group sessions integrating advice for physical activity (PA), and nutrition, cognitive training, and three preventive consultations), the multidomain intervention plus placebo, or placebo alone. Our primary outcome was the change from baseline to 36 months of the muscle strength assessed with the repeated chair stand test and handgrip strength. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 1680 participants (75.34 years +/- 4.42) were randomized. In the modified intention-to-treat population (n = 1679), no significant differences at 3-year follow-up were observed in the repeated chair stand test score between any of the three intervention groups and the placebo group. The between-group differences compared with placebo were -0.05388 (-0.6800 to 0.5723; Standard Error, SE = 0.3192; p = 0.8660) for the omega3-PUFA group, -0.3936 (-1.0217 to 0.2345; SE = 0.3180; p = 0.2192) for the multidomain intervention plus placebo group, and -0.6017 (-1.2255 to 0.02222; SE = 0.2092; p = 0.3202) for the combined intervention group. No significant effect was also found for the handgrip strength. Sensitivity analyses performed among participants with low (DHA+EPA) erythrocyte level at baseline (first quartile vs. others) or highly adherent participants (>=75% of the multidomain intervention sessions) revealed similar results. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Low dose omega3-PUFA supplementation, either alone or in combination with a multidomain lifestyle intervention comprising physical activity counselling, had no significant effects on muscle strength over 3 years in elderly people.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Institutionalized elderly are at higher risk for micronutrient deficiency. In particular, fat soluble micronutrients, which additionally have antioxidative function, are of interest. The purpose of this secondary investigation of the Vienna Active Ageing Study was to assess and evaluate the plasma status of retinol, alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, alpha- and beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene, as well as vitamin D (25(OH)D) in a cohort of institutionalized elderly. We further determined the effect of six months strength training with or without supplementing (antioxidant) vitamins and protein on the plasma status of these ten micronutrients. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Three groups (n = 117, age = 83.1 +/- 6.1 years)resistance training (RT), RT combined with protein and vitamin supplementation (RTS), or cognitive training (CT)performed two guided training sessions per week for six months. Micronutrients were measured with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) at baseline and after 6 months of intervention. Physical fitness was assessed by the 6-min-walking, the 30-s chair rise, isokinetic dynamometry, and the handgrip strength tests. <ovid:br/>Result(s): At baseline, the plasma status of retinol was satisfactory, for alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, and 25(OH)D, the percentage of individuals with an insuffcient status was 33%, 73% and 61%/81% (when using 50 nmol/L or 75 nmol/L as threshold levels for 25(OH)D), respectively. Plasma analyses were supported by intake data. Six months of elastic band resistance training with or without protein-vitamin supplementation had no biological impact on the status of fat soluble micronutrients. Even for vitamin D, which was part of the nutritional supplement (additional 20 03BCg/d), the plasma status did not increase significantly, however it contributed to a lower percentage of elderly below the threshold levels of 50/75 nmol/L (49%/74%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The findings of the study lead to the strong recommendation for regular physical activity and increased consumption of plant-based foods in institutionalized elderly. When supported by blood analysis, supplementing micronutrients in a moderate range should also be considered.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is prevalent in the general United States population, and in the veteran population. T2DM has consistently been linked to increased risk for cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is practical and inexpensive cognitive interventions that is an alternative to medication. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To report the recruitment methods and challenges to date in an ongoing two-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) of CCT on cognitive function and T2DM management in an older non-demented veteran population. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Veterans are recruited primarily by targeted mailings or by direct contact at clinics and presentations. <ovid:br/>Result(s): From 1,459 original contacts, 437 expressed initial interest, 111 provided informed consent, and 97 completed baseline assessments. Participants from the two VA Medical Centers differed in demographics and baseline characteristics. Comparing recruitment methods, the proportion of individuals contacted who were ultimately consented was significantly less from mailings (5%) than other sources (20%), primarily face- to-face clinic visits (chi 2 (1)=38.331, p<0.001). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Mailings are cost-effective, but direct contact improved recruitment. Not using or lacking access to computers and ineligibility were major reasons for non-participation. Within-site comparisons of demographically diverse sites can address confounding of demographic and other site differences.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Background: Metamemory is the process of monitoring and controlling one's memory. Improving metamemory may reduce the memory problem in old age. We hypothesized that metamemory training (MMT) would improve cognition in older adults with subjective memory complaints and change the brain region related to metacognition. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We recruited and randomized older adults to the multi-strategic memory training of 10 weekly 90-min sessions, based on the metamemory concept or usual care. Cognitive tests including the Elderly Verbal Learning Test, Simple Rey Figure Test, Digit Span, Spatial Span, Categorical Fluency, and the Boston Naming Test were done in 201 participants, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 49 participants before and after training. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 112 in the training group and 89 in the control group participated. The training group had a significant increase in long-term delayed free recall, categorical fluency, and the Boston Naming test. In MRI, the mean diffusivity of the bundles of axon tracts passing from the frontal lobe to the posterior end of the lateral sulcus decreased in the training group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These results indicate that the MMT program has a positive impact on enhancing older people' cognitive performance. Improved white matter integrity in the anterior and posterior cerebrum and increased cortical thickness of prefrontal regions, which related to metacognition, possibly suggest that the effects of the MMT would be induced via the enhancement of cognitive control.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The Authors.

N2  - Background and aims.- Cognitive impairment in elderly is a problem of high significance due to the increasing prevalence. Comprehensive cognitive rehabilitation programs (CCRP) are used to improve cognitive functioning. At the initial level of cognitive decline, it is not always possible to diagnose correctly the nature of cognitive impairment and to predict the course of disorder. Immune markers assessment can bring the light to the severity of brain damage. Aims.- To assess dynamics of cognitive functioning before and after CCRP in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MGI) and its association with immune markers (leukocyte elastase, autoantibodies to S100 protein (abS100) and myelin basic protein (abMBP)) levels. Methods.- Prospective study of unselected sample of patients with MCI. Patients (n = 61) were recruited in the outpatient public 'Memory Clinic' in Moscow. Exclusion criteria were depression and anxiety (HADS score >10), history of psychosis, acute somatic diseases. Immune markers were assessed in plasma at baseline. Cognitive parameters were assessed using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) at baseline and in 6 weeks, after completing CCRP. The difference in MMSE score >2 considered as clinically significant improvement. Difference in immune parameters was compared in groups with and without cognitive improvement using Pearson's 2 test. Results.- Eighteen (29,5%) patients showed no significant improvement after CCRP. This correlated with more malignant immune profile in this group with significantly higher levels of autoanti bodies then in patients with significant improvement (2 = 4.18, p < 0.05). Conclusions.- Levels of autoantibodies can be used as markers of more severe brain damage in patients with clinical picture of MCI.

N2  - Objective: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an increasingly adopted technology for promoting and maintaining brain function and resilience. Recent advances are identifying tDCS over left temporal cortex and working memory training (WMT) as a promising treatment for mild cognitive decline, but which is more likely benefit from the single or combined modality is still unclear. This study sough to examine the effect of tDCS and WMT on cognition and its sustainability. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a 12-week, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial involving the cases with mild neurocognitive disorder duo to Alzheimer's disease (NCD-AD), defined as Cantonese Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24 to 28. NCD-AD patients were randomly assigned to receive tDCS, WMT or combined tDCS with WMT for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to week 4 in the score on Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale and memory tests (Delayed recall). <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 201 cases were enrolled, of whom 68 were assigned to receive only tDCS, 64 to receive only WMT, and 60 to receive a combination of tDCS and WMT. Combined tDCS and WMT group demonstrated greater enhancement of memory than the other two groups at week 4 (Delayed recall). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Single modality, either tDCS or WMT, has positive effects on major domains of cognition. A combination of tDCS and WMT shows better treatment effect than single modality, particularly on memory domain, which highlights the possibility to launch cost-effective brain intervention in healthy aging community.

N2  - Background: Stroke is one of the leading causes of permanent disabilities. In addition to motor deficits, cognitive impairments are a significant burden to stroke survivors. Yet, there are few effective therapeutic approaches readily available to chronic stroke survivors. Clinical evidence suggests that computer-based approaches could be effective in improving cognitive function of stroke survivors. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To validate the therapeutic effectiveness of serious mobile games that were developed for cognitive rehabilitation, among chronic stage stroke survivors with moderate cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A randomized controlled, single-center clinical trial was conducted in a long-term care rehabilitation center in South Korea. Fifty stroke survivors in the chronic stage (at least 1-year post-stroke) with moderate cognitive impairment were recruited. Subjects were randomized to standard medical care (n=25) or standard medical care plus serious games (n=25). The intervention, which was performed independently in their rehabilitation setting by stroke survivors, lasted 3 months. Standard cognitive tests were performed at baseline and post-intervention. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A two-way mixed model ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc tests identified significant differences in the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination, digit backward span, and geriatric depression scale between the experimental and the control groups after the intervention but not at baseline. Within the experimental group, there were statistically significant improvements in all the outcomes except for the language category of Korean Mini-Mental State Examination. Within the control group, there were no improvements in any of the outcomes. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The use of specifically designed serious games by chronic stroke survivors can lead to improvements in several aspects of cognitive function.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019

N2  - Background: Dementia and Delirium involve a high assistance due to the BPSD. The care requires a multicomponent approach based on psychogeriatric skills, specialized nursing training and use of psychosocial interventions. In our Geriatric Ward we promoted a pilot project with aim of realizing a new model of care that reduces length of stay, physical and pharmacological restrains, risk of medical complications and mortality and improves quality of life. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We proposed a longitudinal observational pilot case-control study. In the phase 1 we organized a staff training on BPSD management and delirium care; in phase 2 we requested a specialized therapist on multisensory interventions, cognitive stimulation and occupational activities conducted in a special environment (Snoezelen Room).We admitted in the study the elderly people who presented delirium (assessed by 4AT >= 4) or BPSD in phase of decompensation (evaluated by NPI score > 24 or at least one single item > 12 ) using a CGA both patient (MMSE, 4AT, MDAS, NPI, CIRS, GDS 15 item, Conley, ADL / IADL, Barthel,Apache) and caregiver ( Zarit and SCQ). The answer to the care was monitored daily (frequency and gravity of behavioral disturbaces, use of psychotropics agents, restrains, falls and length of stay ) in the study group (SG) compared to a control group (CG) defined by eldelrly people admitted to a Medical Ward with the same characteristics (age, comorbidity and type of delirium or BPSD). After the discharge we performed a 2 months follow up that evaluated mortality, re- admission, accesses in ER. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 24 cases and 43 controls were recruited. Patients admitted to GW had more cognitive-behavioral disorders, major complications and a greater risk of mortality but we observed a reduction of BPSD in the SG (treated with psychosocial interventions) compared to the CG. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): our preliminary observations shows that the project, however complex, was feasible and psychosocial interventions and staff training are able to make a difference on the quality of life for people with dementia or delirium admitted in our "Dementia Friendly " Ward and could reduce staff and caregivers stress. There is need for further studies to confirm these observations.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019

N2  - Background: Current research into dementia prevention has shown cognitive outcomes resulting from multidomain lifestyle interventions. Worldwide initiatives to develop these interventions have been initiated recently. Our aim is to describe the experimental design and the recruitment strategy of the pilot study of Argentine FINGER, the first experience with multidomain lifestyle intervention in dementia prevention in Latin America. <ovid:br/>Method(s): 150 Participants will be recruited from the databases of the Center of Memory and Ageing at FLENI and affiliated institutions at Buenos Aires, Argentina. Inclusion criteria will be cognitively asymptomatic older adults (60-79 years) with a first-degree family history of memory impairment, sedentarism, inadequate diet and a CAIDE (cardiovascular risk factors, Aging and Dementia) Dementia Risk Score of 6 or higher. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a Self-Guided (N=75) or a Structured Lifestyle (N=75) Intervention. The Self-Guided Intervention group will receive information on nutritional, healthcare, physical exercise and cognitive stimulation. The Structured Lifestyle Intervention group will follow a protocol including dietary counseling (Dash Diet), physical exercise, cognitive training and health coaching (focused on control of cardiovascular risk factors). Outcomes will include NPS assessment (Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Story Recall, Visual Paired Associates, Number Span, Word Fluency, Trail-Making, Digit Symbol Substitution Test), clinical and behavioral questionnaires, physical exam, and blood workup APOE and Brain scan MRI. Longitudinal follow up will last 12 months and will include outcome assessment at baseline, month 6 and month 12. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The review of FLENI database identified 235 subjects with normal neurological exam and normal standardized scores on all subtests of UDS2 NPS battery. Subjects met inclusion criteria for the Argentine Finger and they are 51% male, age range 60-79 and have normal MMSE score (mean Z score 0,14 +/- 0,7). These subjects will be contacted and invited to participate in the study. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): We accomplished the first stage of the recruitment process for the Argentine-Finger. Database findings suggest enrollment for Argentine-Finger pilot study will be successful. This is an important step to prove the feasibility of a Multi-domain intervention in Latin American population.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019

N2  - Background: The prevalence of dementia is increasing with age. Although some exercise intervention studies have tried to improve and maintain physical and cognitive function, it is necessary to determine the optimal amount and frequency for better outcomes. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a short-term multicomponent exercise program on physical and cognitive function in community-dwelling healthy elderly people. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We recruited a total of 33 subjects who were >70 years old and had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of >=24. Subjects were randomly allocated to either a multicomponent exercise group (MEG) or a waiting group (WG). Patients in the MEG exercised for 90 min/d, 1 d/wk for 3 months. The exercise program consisted of cognitive training, stretching, muscle strength exercises, and aerobic exercises under dual tasks. The WG was provided no training over during 3 months and was provided the same exercise intervention as MEG at the end of the study (UMIN-CTR: UMIN000027740). Trained staff administered the timed up and go test, grip strength, MMSE, the Trail Making Test (A and B), and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised logical memory for immediate and delayed recall. The effects of the exercise intervention on physical/cognitive function, as defined with repeated measures, were estimated in a generalized linear mixed model. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Out of 33 subjects, 17 subjects were allocated to the MEG (mean age, 77.6 +/- 3.9 years; female, n = 10) and 16 to the WG (76.5 +/- 3.5 years; n = 10). One subject in both groups dropped out, leaving 16 subjects in MEG and 15 subjects in WG for the final analysis. The MMSE score did not change after 3 months of exercise in the MEG (from pre: 27.4 +/- 1.9 to post: 27.4 +/- 2.0), but decreased from 28.5 +/- 1.7 to 26.7 +/- 2.2 in the WG. There was a significant interaction between group x time (p = 0.035), but none of the other variables had significant interaction effects. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results suggest that a multicomponent exercise program is beneficial to maintain general cognitive function (MMSE) in community-dwelling healthy elderly people.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019

N2  - Background and aims: Divergent thinking (DT) has recently attracted neuroscientists' attention for its potential role in terms of diagnosis and rehabilitation for patients affected by a neurodegenerative disease. Some recent studies have demonstrated an early DT decline in Alzheimer's disease patients; however, less is known about patients affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Our study aims to preliminary evaluates the relationships between DT, wide-ranging cognition, cognitive reserve (CR) and psychological conditions in this population. <ovid:br/>Method(s): 24 MCI patients and 25 controls (from a random selection of 60) have been recruited. The main measures were: general cognitive functioning (Mini-Mental State Examination - MMSE and Montreal Cognitive Assessment -MoCA), CR index (CRIq), DT (Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults - ATTA) and selected psychological measures. <ovid:br/>Result(s): MCI patients performed worse at MMSE and MOCA tests; they are also under the controls' mean in the flexibility subscores of the ATTA. In the control sample, significant positive correlations were found between different DT and CRIq subscores. (Table presented) <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our preliminary results seemed to show that there is a significant positive correlation between DT and CR, age and education level in healthy aging subjects; however, this was not replicated in the pathological sample. These results allow us to hypothesise that cognitive decline, which seemed to be already in progress in MCI patients, could affect early some DT abilities and its relationships with CR. Future research should be focused on the cognitive processes that could influence this relationship and on the implication of DT in terms of prevention and/or cognitive stimulation programs.

N2  - Introduction: Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with both cognitive impairment and depression. However, the extent to which these factors are associated with cognitive impairment in patients with mild neurocognitive disorder with and without a history of lifetime depression needs to be clarified. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We looked at the distribution of Framingham Risk Scores (FRS) for cardiovascular disease in three groups of participants age 60 years and older in the Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia with Cognitive Remediation plus Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (PACt-MD) study: those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 42), remitted major depressive disorder (MDD, n =29), or MCI plus remitted MDD (n = 21). We also examined the association between cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) using the non-parametric Spearman's rank order correlation test. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were no differences in the severity of FRS across the three diagnostic groups (p=0.281). Comparison of age, gender, education, and cognitive scores across FRS severity groups showed a significant correlation of increased FRS severity with higher age (p=0.016) and lower MOCA (p=0.023). When we assessed the correlation between specific cardiovascular risk factors (i.e hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) and MMSE, MOCA, and MADRS, the only significant correlation was found to be between a history of hypertension and lower MOCA scores (p=0.001). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The similar FRS distribution across MDD and MCI provides further support for the association of cardiovascular burden with both MDD and cognitive impairment. Hypertension was the only cardiovascular risk factor that was correlated with cognitive impairment. Future research is needed to clarify the mechanism behind this association.

N2  - Introduction: Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of the most devastating neurological disorder of many neurological conditions due to its social and economic impact. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can enable stimulation of the brain and modulate neuronal excitability and enhance cortical function. The therapeutic effect of rTMS with cognitive training (CT) in mild AD has proved in the previous randomized controlled study. In contrast, the cognitive benefit in moderate to severe AD patients has not proved yet. We evaluate the cognitive effect of rTMS-CT in patients with moderate to severe AD and compare its therapeutic magnitude with mild AD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We recruited AD patients who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease by DSM-IV criteria and received rTMS-CT in our hospital. Most of the participants had been enrolled in our previous two RCTs. The others who wanted to get rTMS-CT were included this analyses. All participants were undertaken brain MRIs for a navigation system and neuropsychological assessments including ADAS-cog, MMSE, and geriatric depression scale (GDS). The rTMS protocols were configured for six cortical areas (both dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal somatosensory associated cortices and Broca's and Wernicke's areas; 10Hz, 90-110% intensity, and 5 days/week for 6 weeks). Neuropsychological assessments were performed before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after the end of treatment. We analyzed improvement of cognitive function and depression after rTMS-CT in mild (MMSE score= 21~26) and moderate to severe (MMSE score < 20) AD. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Cognitive function assessed by ADAS-cog after rTMS-CT in 6w and 12w has significantly improved compared with the baseline, prior to rTMS-CT in both groups (34 mild, 13, moderate to severe). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): rTMS-CT may be a potential treatment modality to slow or delay cognitive decline in AD.

N2  - Objectives: In a randomised controlled trial, we investigated whether a cognitive training based on rhythm-music and music improvisation exercises had positive effects on executive functions in older participants. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Thirty-five residents in a guest home with mild-moderate cognitive impairment and healthy ageing were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 18) featuring cognitive music training composed of 12 bi-weekly 70-min sessions, and a control group (n = 17) attended 12 bi-weekly 45-min sessions of gymnastic activities offered by the institute. A neuropsychological test battery was administered at baseline and at the end of treatment, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, verbal fluency test, Trail Making Test A, attentional matrices test and clock-drawing test. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Pre-test and post-test comparison showed a significant improvement for the experimental group reflected in the Mini-Mental State Examination (F(1,33) = 13.906; p < 0.001; peta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.296), verbal fluency test (VFL) (F(1,33) = 6.816; p < 0.013; peta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.171), and clock-drawing test (F(1,29) = 16.744; p < 0.001; peta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.366), while the control group did not show any significant improvements. In addition, there was a tendency towards significance for the Trail Making Test A (F(1,20) = 3.268; p < 0.086; peta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.140). Regarding the attentional matrices test, no significant differences were found for the experimental group (F(1,29) = 2.833; p < 0.103; peta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.089), while the control group had a significant performance reduction (F(1,29) = 3.947; p < 0.050; peta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.120). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The use of a cognitive protocol based on music-rhythmic exercises and music improvisation exercises is associated with improved cognitive functions in older people with mild-moderate cognitive impairment regardless of the individual's degree of cognitive reserve.

T1  - The effects of computer-based cognitive rehabilitation program (CoTras) on the verbal fluency of korean patients with mild dementia
A1  - Byeon H.
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Background/Objectives: The objectives of this study were to identify the effects of computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CACR) program on the verbal fluency among the executive functions of the prefrontal lobe and provide the baseline data for the cognitive-linguistic rehabilitation of dementia patients. Method/Statistical analysis: This study selected 25 patients who were diagnosed with mild dementia by a psychiatrist among the dementia patients. The subjects were randomly assigned to the treatment group (n=13), which conducted a CACR intervention program, and the control group (n=12), which carried out a traditional cognitive rehabilitation intervention program (e.g., pencil and paper, and table-top activity). CoTras was used for the CACR program. The controlled oral word association test (COWAT) was conducted to measure the cognitive level by using the computerized neurocognitive function test (CNT). <ovid:br/>Finding(s): The results of ANCOVA showed that the changes in the semantic fluency (total score) anMMSE-K (total score) were significantly (p<0.05) different between the treatment group and the controgroup. The results of parameter estimation revealed that the semantic fluency of the treatment group was 1.higher than that of the control group on average and the difference was significant. Moreover, the MMSE-of the treatment group was 1.1 higher than that of the control group on average and the difference wasignificant. On the other hand, the phonemic fluency was significantly increased after 4 weeks of treatmencompared to baseline in both treatment and control groups. However, it was not significantly differenbetween the treatment group and the control group. Improvements/Applications: The results of this study suggest that the CACR program is more effective iimproving the semantic fluency than the traditional cognitive rehabilitation program. Randomized controlletrials are needed to verify the effects of long-term CACR programs.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

N2  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a cognitive training program on global cognition among people with mild cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In this experimental study, using purposive sampling, 60 participants age 50 years and over who complained of subjective memory impairment were screened in their communities by public health volunteers with the Abbreviated Mental Test. Those with dementia were excluded as well as those with depression, which were screened out by the Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS-15). Mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed and confirmed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and joint agreement between a psychiatrist and a neurologist. The participants were alternately assigned to receive a cognitive training program (intervention group) while the other half received their normal usual therapy (control group). The program involved training of 4 aspects of cognition through 6 sessions; 2 sessions per month for 3 months. The MoCA and TGDS-15 scales were given at baseline and again at week 13, and at months 6 and 9. Independent t-tests were used to compare changes in global cognition among the two groups. <ovid:br/>Result(s): MoCA scores at 9 months were significantly higher than at baseline in both groups. However, the mean difference in intervention group was significantly higher than control group. TGDS-15 scores at 6 months was significantly lower than at baseline among the intervention group but not the control group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This cognitive training program helped to improve global cognition and reduce depressive symptoms.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The pathophysiological mechanism of freezing of gait (FoG) has been linked to executive dysfunction. Cognitive training (CT) is a non-pharmacological intervention which has been shown to improve executive functioning in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to explore whether targeted CT can reduce the severity of FoG in PD. Patients with PD who self-reported FoG and were free from dementia were randomly allocated to receive either a CT intervention or an active control. Both groups were clinician-facilitated and conducted twice-weekly for seven weeks. The primary outcome was percentage of time spent frozen during a Timed Up and Go task, assessed both on and off dopaminergic medications. Secondary outcomes included multiple neuropsychological and psychosocial measures. A full analysis was first conducted on all participants randomized, followed by a sample of interest including only those who had objective FoG at baseline, and completed the intervention. Sixty-five patients were randomized into the study. The sample of interest included 20 in the CT group and 18 in the active control group. The primary outcome of percentage time spent frozen during a gait task was significantly improved in the CT group compared to active controls in the on-state. There were no differences in the off-state. Patients who received CT also demonstrated improved processing speed and reduced daytime sleepiness compared to those in the active control. The findings suggest that CT can reduce the severity of FoG in the on-state, however replication in a larger sample is required.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: Early intervention to reduce cognitive decline and preserve functioning is a compelling public health issue. Because impaired attention occurs early in the process of cognitive impairment, focusing training strategies upon attention may be a potential intervention to prevent further cognitive decline. We sought to test the effects on cognitive performance and daily functioning of a new cognitive training program that focuses on attention. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This single-blind randomized controlled trial lasted 6 months and included two phases. Assessments were conducted at baseline, at 3 months, and at 6 months. The study was performed in four community older adult centers. Ninety-three participants with subjective cognitive impairment without dementia were included. Forty-seven participants were randomized to the Integrated Attention Training Program (IATP), and 46 were randomized to the control group. The two arms of the study included the IATP (intervention group) and a health-related education program (active control group). <ovid:br/>Result(s): No significant interactions were identified between group and time for the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes and other secondary outcomes, except for the Digit Forward Score (p <.05; effect size, 0.057). When the preintervention and postintervention results were compared, the IATP group showed significant improvement in grand mean effect (p <.05) and accuracy (p <.05) in the Attention Network Test, Digit Backward Score (p <.05), Category Verbal Fluency Test (p <.05), and Trail Making Test A (p <.01) immediately after the intervention. These improvements were sustained 3 months after the intervention. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The IATP showed domain-specific effects but had no effects on global cognition or functioning. It could not show a superior benefit in cognition and functioning when compared with non-specific mental stimulation in a group format. Further studies are needed to determine the role of attention in cognitive training.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2016.

N2  - Background: Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) show lower decision making and ratio processing abilities as compared to healthy peers. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To evaluate whether cognitive training on number processing and/or executive functions improves performance on ratio processing and decision making under risk. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In a controlled cross-over study, patients with MCI (n = 23; mean MMSE 26.48, SD 2.43) underwent a week of numerical training followed by a week of executive-functions training (subgroup A), or vice versa (subgroup B). Before training (T1), patients performed experimental tasks of decision making (Game of Dice Task, GDT; Probability-Associated Gambling task, PAG-60 task) and of ratio processing as well as a neuropsychological background assessment. Experimental tasks were also administered after the first (T2) and the second (T3) training week. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The numerical training and the training of executive functions had a differential effect on experimental tasks of ratio processing. Only the numerical training proved to be effective. The effects of the two training types on decision making under risk were less clear-cut. While no changes over time were observed in the GDT, performance on the PAG-60 task improved in both training subgroups. These improvements were apparent in one subgroup after a period of executive-functions training, in the other subgroup after both training weeks. That means, improvements are not attributable to one specific training type. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Patients with MCI can profit from a cognitive training on number processing and executive functions. Improvements are reflected in higher ratio processing abilities and more advantageous decisions after training. These results are consistent with assumptions of current cognitive models.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Cognitive training (CT) is a non-pharmacological intervention based on a set of tasks that reflect specific cognitive functions. CT is aimed at improving cognition in patients with cognitive impairment, though no definitive conclusions have yet been drawn on its efficacy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To assess the effectiveness of a CT program designed to improve cognition in AD patients. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, longitudinal trial with a no-treatment control condition in mild-to-moderate AD. Treated patients received in-group CT twice a week for six months, whereas controls did not. CT consisted of tasks ranging from paper-and-pencil to verbal-learning exercises. Participants' cognitive levels were assessed at baseline, post-intervention and 6 months later by means of a complete neuropsychological test battery. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze the effect of time on the outcome measures, as well as to compare treated and untreated patients over time, with demographic data considered as covariates. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of the 140 patients enrolled, 45 in the treated group and 85 controls concluded the study. The CT significantly improved treated subjects' cognitive functions immediately after the CT. Six months later, some test scores remained stable when compared with those obtained at baseline. The control group performed significantly worse than the treated group at each time-point, displaying a progressive cognitive decline over time. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that CT may improve cognitive functions in patients with AD and may help to temporarily slow their cognitive decline.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Background: Biomarkers of oxidative stress have been associated with cognitive status in humans and have been proposed to guide prognosis/treatment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The aim of this study was to compare oxidative stress status in the plasma of mild-moderate AD, MCI, and healthy elderly with normal cognition (HE) undergoing a non-pharmacological intervention including multi-modal cognitive training ("My Mind Project"). <ovid:br/>Method(s): A prospective randomized trial involving 321 elderly people enrolled in Marche Region, Italy. Each subject was randomly assigned to an experimental (cognitive training) or to a control group. Cognitive performances and biomarkers have been analyzed before intervention (baseline), immediately after termination (follow-up 1), after 6 months (follow-up 2), and after 2 years (follow-up 3). The biological antioxidant potential (BAP) to Diacron reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM) ratio has been used as an indicator of oxidative stress status and as outcome variable. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We have found no differences in the oxidative status among AD, MCI, and HE. Neither did we find a significant effect of the intervention within experimental groups. Gender was the sole factor with a strong significant effect on BAP/d-ROM. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Based on these results, the utility of biomarkers of oxidative stress to guide prognosis/treatment in AD or MCI seems to be limited by lack of specificity, large interindividual variability, and gender bias.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Background. In a randomized control trial conducted in patients with Parkinson's disease, a treadmill training program combined with virtual reality that targeted motor and cognitive aspects of safe ambulation led to fewer falls, compared with treadmill training alone. Objective. To investigate if the 2 types of training differentially affected prefrontal activation and if this might explain differences in fall rates after the intervention. Methods. Sixty-four patients with Parkinson's disease were randomized into the treadmill training arm (n = 34, mean age 73.1 +/- 1.1 years, 64% men, disease duration 9.7 +/- 1.0 years) or treadmill training with virtual reality arm (n = 30, mean age 70.1 +/- 1.3 years, 71% men, disease duration 8.9 +/- 1.1 years). Prefrontal activation during usual, dual-task, and obstacle negotiation walking was assessed before and after 6 weeks of training, using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy system. Results. Treadmill training with and without virtual reality reduced prefrontal activation during walking (P <.001), with specific interactions related to training arm (P =.01), lateralization (P =.05), and walking condition (P =.001). For example, among the subjects who trained with treadmill training alone, prefrontal activation during dual-task walking and obstacle negotiation increased after training, while in the combined training arm, activation decreased. Conclusions. Prefrontal activation during usual and during more challenging walking conditions can be altered in response to 2 different types of training. The addition of a cognitive training component to a treadmill exercise program apparently modifies the effects of the training on the magnitude and lateralization of prefrontal activation and on falls, extending the understanding of the plasticity of the brain in PD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018, &#xa9; The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - The cognitive impairment characterizing the phenotype of older adults has been related to the efficiency of the antioxidant system. This study aimed at investigating the effect of memory training (MT) on memory, global cognitive functioning, and the oxidant and antioxidant capacity of plasma. We recruited 52 healthy subjects aged over 60. Twenty-nine subjects were submitted to 6-months of MT (Experimental Group, EG), and 23 were used as a Control Group (CG). Global cognitive functioning was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Short- and Long-Term Memory (STM and LTM, respectively) by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) at baseline (T0) and after 6-months (T1). Meanwhile, Reactive Oxygen Metabolites derivative compounds (d-ROMs), Biological Antioxidant Potential (BAP), and their ratio were evaluated on plasma. Results showed that the MMSE and RAVLT scores improved in EG at T1. At the same time, the d-ROMs levels significantly decreased, while the BAP and BAP/d-ROMs ratio showed an opposite trend. In both groups, the MMSE and LTM scores were negatively associated with d-ROMs levels, and positively correlated with BAP levels and the BAP/d-ROMs ratio. When we considered the DELTAvalue (DELTAvariable = variable post-MT minus variable pre-MT) in EG, the DELTAMMSE and DELTALTM scores were negatively associated to DELTAd-ROMs, and positively to DELTABAP and DELTABAP/dROM. In conclusion, our results suggest that MT improves memory and global cognitive functioning. These processes were significantly associated to increase in resistance against oxidative stress at the plasma level in healthy older adults.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 The Authors

N2  - Background: The objective of this study was to investigate whether a long-term multidomain lifestyle intervention was associated with the severity and incidence of frailty in older adults. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A 3-year randomized controlled trial was conducted among 1637 French community dwellers age >=70: 821 controls and 816 who received a multidomain lifestyle intervention (cognitive training, nutrition counseling, and advice on physical activity). The intervention involved 12 2-hour sessions (in the first 2 months) followed by a 1-hour session each month until the study end. Controls received the usual care but did not receive any personalized lifestyle intervention. A frailty index (FI; range = 0-1, higher is worse) composed of 32 items was calculated at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years and constituted our main endpoint. FI >= 0.25 defined frailty. The 4 outcomes were severity of frailty (continuous FI score), incident frailty, incidence of persistent frailty (frailty at 2 consecutive time points), and reversibility of frailty (from frailty to nonfrailty). <ovid:br/>Result(s): Mixed-effect linear regression did not find a significant effect of the multidomain intervention on FI score. Frailty incidence occurred in 241 of 1146 subjects (138 controls and 103 in the multidomain group), whereas incidence of persistent frailty occurred in 75 of 1042 subjects (48 controls and 27 in the multidomain group). Cox models adjusted for baseline FI scores showed that compared with controls, subjects in the multidomain group had a decreased risk of developing both frailty (hazard ratio 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.93) and persistent frailty (hazard ratio 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.85). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This multidomain lifestyle intervention was associated with a reduced risk of developing frailty but did not affect the severity of frailty in community-dwelling older adults.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018

N2  - Background: A computerized cognitive rehabilitation program can be used to treat patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. We developed a new computerized cognitive rehabilitation program (Bettercog) that contained various treatment programs for cognitive training for mild cognitive impairment or dementia. This study was conducted to compare the clinical efficacy of Bettercog and computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation (COMCOG) that has had clinical efficacy previously proven in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Randomized, single-blind comparison pilot study of 20 elderly patients with cognitive decline-eight men and 12 women -with an average age of 74.3 years. Bettercog trains not only memory and attention but also orientation, calculation, executive function, language, comprehension, and spatiotemporal abilities. To retain subjects' interest, pictures, animations, and game elements were introduced. The subjects were divided into COMCOG and Bettercog groups by random assignment and underwent 12 sessions of a computerized cognitive rehabilitation program for three weeks. In a separate space, an independent clinical psychologist conducted the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery 2nd edition (SNSB-II), Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and the Korean version of the Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI) before and after treatment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There was no significant difference between the two groups in baseline age, sex, illiteracy, years of education, and scores on the K-MMSE, CDR, SNSB-II, and K-MBI. In the posttreatment cognitive assessment, the K-MMSE scores of patients treated with Bettercog improved from 19.2 +/- 3.9 to 21.3 +/- 4.0 (P = .005). In the memory domain of the SNSB-II, the percentile score improved from 15.3 +/- 24.5 to 24.2 +/- 30.7 (P = .026). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the final K-MMSE, CDR, and SNSB-II scores between the two treatment groups. In both groups, K-MBI scores improved statistically significantly after treatment. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Through this preliminary study, we verified that the newly developed computerized cognitive rehabilitation program is effective in improving cognitive function. However, 12 sessions are not enough to administer a variety of cognitive rehabilitation content to patients. It is, therefore, necessary to conduct a large-scale study using a computerized cognitive rehabilitation program that has various cognitive content.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 the Author(s).

N2  - Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a virtual reality training with BTS Nirvana (BTS-N) system in the cognitive and behavioral recovery in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). The BTS-N is a semi-immersive therapy system used for motor and cognitive rehabilitation of patients with neurological diseases, by creating virtual scenarios with which the patient may interact. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We enrolled 20 patients with PD undergoing neurorehabilitation. All the patients were randomized into 2 groups: experimental group performing semi-immersive virtual reality training with BTS-N and control group undergoing traditional cognitive training. Each participant was evaluated before and immediately after the end of the training. Each cognitive training consisted of 3 sessions a week, each lasting 60 minutes, for 8 weeks, for a total of 24 sessions in each group. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Experimental group showed a greater improvement in cognitive functioning, with regard to executive and visuospatial abilities, as compared with the control group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that rehabilitation through a new virtual reality instrument could be a valuable tool in improving cognitive and behavioral outcomes of patients with PD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Background: Apathy, commonly defined as the loss of motivation, is a symptom frequently encountered in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The treatment of apathy remains challenging in the absence of any truly effective medications. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) or Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) can improve cognitive disorders, but do not appear to improve apathy. Isolated cognitive training also appears to have no effect on apathy. We propose to test the efficacy of a new procedure for the treatment of apathy in AD patients consisting of a combination of tDCS and cognitive training, based on the latest guidelines for the design of therapeutic trials in this field. Methods/Design: This article primarily describes the design of a monocentre, randomized, double-blind trial to be conducted in France to evaluate the effect of the combination of tDCS and cognitive training on apathy compared to a group treated exclusively by cognitive training (sham tDCS). Twen-ty-four patients under the age of 90 years with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (Mini Mental State Examination score between 15 and 26/30) (MMSE)) presenting clinically significant apathy evaluated by the Apathy Inventory (AI) and the NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI) apathy subscore will be enrolled. Severe depression will be excluded by using the NPI depression subscore. Treatment will comprise 10 sessions (D0-D11) including tDCS (bilateral prefrontal, temporal and parietal tar-gets) and Cognitive Training (Cog) (6 simple tasks involving working memory, language and visuospatial function). After randomization (ratio 2:1), 16 patients will receive the complete treatment comprising tDCS and Cog (group 1) and 8 patients will be treated exclusively by Cog (sham tDCS) (group 2). The primary endpoint will be a significant improvement of the AI score by comparing baseline measures (D-15) to those recorded one month after stopping treatment (D44). Secondary end-points will be an improvement of this score immediately after treatment (D14), 2 weeks (D29) and 2 months (D74) after stopping treatment and improvement of the MMSE score, NPI apathy subscore, ADAS Cog (Alzheimer Disease Assessment cognitive Scale subsection), ADCS-ADL (Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living), FAB (Frontal Assessment Battery) and the latency of P300 evoked potentials at the same timepoints. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The purpose of our study is to check the assumption of tDCS and cognitive training efficacy in the treatment of apathy encountered in AD patients and we will discuss its effect over time.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Background. While the efficacy of cognitive stimulation (CS) has been demonstrated in patients with dementia, no study has included patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Objective. For the first time, this randomized crossover pilot study examined the feasibility and potential effects of CS in PDD. Methods. All residents of a PDD-specific long-term care unit in the Netherlands that were eligible for the study (n=12) were randomly allocated to group A (n=6) receiving CS (eight weeks, twice weekly for 60 minutes) or group B (n=6) receiving usual care (control group, CG). The CG participated in CS afterwards, resulting in an experimental group (EG), consisting of n=12. Pre- and postassessments and a six-week follow-up (FU) were conducted for cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life (QoL), and activities of daily living (ADL) outcomes. Results. Between-group analysis with difference scores from pre- to posttest revealed a group difference for global cognition (CERAD total score) favoring the EG, with a moderate effect size and a p value just failing to reach statistical significance (p=0.067; r = 0.43). A further statistical trend was observed for neuropsychiatric symptoms, again with a moderate effect size (p=0.075; r = 0.42). Within-group analyses indicated improvement only in the EG with large effects also just failing to reach significance for global cognition (short term, p=0.060; r = 0.70) as well as for depression (long term, p=0.072; r = 0.61). ADL deteriorated significantly at FU in the EG (p=0.014; r = 0.71). Conclusions. Although our data are preliminary due to the small sample size, this study shows that CS is feasible and potentially effective for cognitive and noncognitive outcomes in PDD patients. Randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these promising results.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Ann-Kristin Folkerts et al.

N2  - Objective: This study aimed to explore whether a computerized cognitive stimulation program (CCS) induced differential effects in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) according to the severity of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), which are associated with cognitive impairment and increased risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease because of the damage they cause to cortical and subcortical networks. <ovid:br/>Patients and Methods: Twenty-nine MCI patients with no or little WMH (MCI-non-WMH) and 22 MCI patients with moderate or severe WMH (MCI-WMH) attended a 24-session CCS program (two sessions per week for a duration of 3 months) focused on executive functions, attention, and processing speed. Cognitive and psychosocial assessments were performed at baseline, postintervention, and 3 months after the intervention. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Both groups improved on several cognitive measures after the intervention. However, the MCI-non-WMH group improved on a higher number of cognitive measures than the MCI-WMH group. At postintervention assessment, CCS had a more beneficial effect on the MCI-non-WMH group than on the MCI-WMH group with regard to improving categorical fluency (4.6+/-6.8 vs 0.4+/-6.4; effect size=0.37; p=0.002). During the 3-month follow-up assessment, significantly higher score improvements were observed in the MCI-non-WMH group for the paired-associate learning test (6.4+/-3 vs 4.7+/-3.5 points; effect size=0.43; p=0.005) as well as categorical fluency (3.8+/-7.8 vs -0.7+/-6 points; effect size=0.55; p=0.0003). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that WMH severity was related to cognitive improvement induced by a CCS program and highlight the importance of considering WMH in interventional studies on subjects with MCI.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Djabelkhir-Jemmi et al.

N2  - Background: Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring can reduce the duration of anesthesia. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of BIS monitoring during surgery for resection of colon carcinoma in elderly patients using the Attention Network Test (ANT) to study alerting, orienting, and executive functions, and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Material/Methods: Eighty-one patients (65-75 years) underwent radical surgery for colon carcinoma with general intravenous anesthesia, propofol (6-8 mg/kg/h), vecuronium (0.03-0.05 mg/kg/min), and remifentanil (0.1-0.2 mug/kg/min). The BIS group (n=41) underwent adjustment of anesthesia to maintain a BIS value between 40-60; the non-BIS group (N=40) underwent standard intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring. Primary endpoints were alerting, orienting, and executive functions assessed pre-operatively and on postoperative days 1 and 5 using the ANT; the secondary endpoint was delirium during the first five postoperative days, assessed using the CAM. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Propofol and remifentanil doses were significantly lower in the BIS group compared with the non-BIS group (P<0.001). Alerting, orienting, and executive functions showed no differences between the two groups pre-operatively but were impaired in both groups on postoperative day 1 compared with pre-operative levels (P<0.001). On postoperative day 5, alerting (P=0.607) and orienting (P=0.851) functions recovered in the BIS group but remained impaired in the non-BIS group (P<0.001). Delirium was significantly lower in the BIS group compared with the non-BIS group (17.5% vs. 27.5%) (P<0.001). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): BIS-guided anesthesia was associated with reduced anesthetic exposure, early postoperative recovery of alerting and orienting functions, and reduced postoperative delirium.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Med Sci Monit,.

N2  - Background: Dementia is a disease that is constantly evolving in older people. Its diverse symptoms appear with varying degrees of severity affecting the daily life of those who suffer from it. The rate in which dementia progresses depends on different aspects of the treatment, chosen to try to control and slow down the development of the illness. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of cognitive training through a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) and the NeuronUp platform in two age groups whose MMSE is between 18-23 MCI (mild dementia). <ovid:br/>Method(s): 32 subjects took part in the study. There were 22 subjects in Group 1 (61-69 years of age) and 10 subjects in Group 2 (70-81 years of age). The criterium for the selection of the groups was to identify the age range with greater improvements due to the training. In order to estimate neuropsychological performance, the subjects were evaluated with the Luria-DNA neuropsychological battery before and after training. This design enables us to evaluate five cognitive areas: visuospatial, spoken language, memory, intellectual processes and attention. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After training, Group 1 showed significant improvements in almost all the variables measured when compared with Group 2. This reveals a significant increase in cognitive ability, the degree of which depends on the age. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): People with mild dementia may delay cognitive impairment with a suitable cognitive training program.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - In mild cognitive impairment (MCI), small benefits from cognitive training were observed for memory functions but there appears to be great variability in the response to treatment. Our study aimed to improve the characterization and selection of those participants who will benefit from cognitive intervention. We evaluated the predictive value of disease-specific biological factors for the outcome after cognitive training in MCI (n = 25) and also considered motivation of the participants. We compared the results of the cognitive intervention group with two independent control groups of MCI patients (local memory clinic, n = 20; ADNI cohort, n = 302). The primary outcome measure was episodic memory as measured by verbal delayed recall of a 10-word list. Episodic memory remained stable after treatment and slightly increased 6 months after the intervention. In contrast, in MCI patients who did not receive an intervention, episodic memory significantly decreased during the same time interval. A larger left entorhinal cortex predicted more improvement in episodic memory after treatment and so did higher levels of motivation. Adding disease-specific biological factors significantly improved the prediction of training-related change compared to a model based simply on age and baseline performance. Bootstrapping with resampling (n = 1000) verified the stability of our finding. Cognitive training might be particularly helpful in individuals with a bigger left entorhinal cortex as individuals who did not benefit from intervention showed 17 less volume in this area. When extended to alternative treatment options, stratification based on disease-specific biological factors is a useful step towards individualized medicine.

N2  - The growing elderly population and the increased incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) call for the improvement of the quality and the efficacy of the healthcare and social support services. Exercise and cognitive stimulation have been demonstrated to mitigate cognitive impairment and oxidative stress (OxS) has been recognized as a factor that contributes to the advancement of neurodegenerative diseases. Taking these aspects into account, the impact of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based program combining aerobic exercise and cognitive training has been evaluated in the pilot study proposed here. Ten patients (aged 73.3 +/- 5.7 years) with MCI (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE: 23.0 +/- 3.4) were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks physical and cognitive training (EXP) or control (CTR) group. Evaluations of cognitive profile, by a neuropsychological tests battery, and OxS, by collection of blood and urine samples, were performed before and at the end of the experimental period. The assessment of the patients' opinions toward the intervention was investigated through questionnaires. EXP group showed a tendency towards improvements in the MMSE, in visual-constructive test and visuo-spatial tests of attention, while CTR worsened. EXP group showed a greater improvement than CTR in the executive test, memory functions and verbal fluency. No statistical significance was obtained when comparing within and between both the groups, probably due to small number of subjects examined, which amplifies the effect of the slight heterogeneity in scores recorded. Despite a greater worsening of Daily Living Activities tests, all participants reported a better performance in real life, thanks to the elicited self-perceived improvement. After training intervention OxS (i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative damage of lipids and DNA) decreased resulting in significantly (range p < 0.05-0.001) lower in EXP vs. CTR group. Although not conclusive, the recorded effects in the present study are promising and suggest that this proposal would be a useful tool in support of cognitive training reducing OxS too. However, further studies on larger scale samples of patients are needed.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Mrakic-Sposta, Di Santo, Franchini, Arlati, Zangiacomi, Greci, Moretti, Jesuthasan, Marzorati, Rizzo, Sacco and Vezzoli.

N2  - Introduction: Cognitive training has attracted considerable attention as a safe, economical, and scalable nonpharmacologic intervention in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, no study has yet placed sufficient emphasis on the training of executive function. The present study aimed to evaluate whether memory training combined with executive training could lead to improved cognitive and noncognitive performance in patients with MCI. Furthermore, we will explore the neural correlates underlying the changed performances. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial that will include 120 patients with MCI. The eligible patients will be randomized to either an intervention group or a waitlist control group. The intervention group will receive computerized combined training (executive function and memory) for 96 sessions for more than 24 weeks. The control group will receive no intervention during the research period. Behavior data collection and a magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalogram/near-infrared spectroscopy scan will be performed at baseline and after 24 weeks of intervention. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The study is currently ongoing. Recruitment began in July 2017 and will conclude in December 2018. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): If combined training results in positive changes to cognitive function and noncognitive function in patients with MCI, this might represent a new approach to delay the cognitive decline or even provide a potential method for dementia prevention. Furthermore, the evaluation of any training-related structural changes or functional changes will help to reveal the mechanisms underlying the combined cognitive training. Trial registration: This study was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03232047, August 18, 2017).<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 The Authors

N2  - People with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) experience cognitive decline and reduction in their motor capacities. Several programs have used physical or cognitive stimulation with encouraging results for the cognitive performances; however, none have studied both together. The goal of this study is to compare the benefits of simultaneous training with the results of single cognitive and physical training on executive, cardiorespiratory and walking measures in order to assess a potential sur-additive effect. Sixty-nine older adults diagnosed with MCI were randomized to simultaneous cognitive and physical training (PCT), physical training only (PT), cognitive training only (CT) or a no-intervention control group (C). Training was provided through 24 1-h sessions. Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests that targeted executive functions both before and after training sessions. They also underwent the Rockport test to measure cardiorespiratory fitness, along with a battery of walking tests. The tests were repeated six months after the training programs had ended to assess long-term effects. A repeated measure ANOVA and planned comparisons revealed significant improvements in executive control and walking capacities in the three training programs. In particular, the PCT groups showed significant improvements in a larger number of outcomes: 8 tests showed increased gains in the PCT group compared with 2 in the PT group and 2 in the CT group. It is more advantageous to provide cognitive and physical activity training simultaneously than in isolation. Gains in cognitive and motor domains could allow a better adaption to situations that require the recruitment of multiple resources.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background: The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) emphasizes the need for effective treatments. Both pharmacological therapies such as nutrition therapy (NT) and nonpharmacologic therapies including traditional treatment or personalized treatment (e.g., physical exercise, music therapy, computerized cognitive training) have been approved for the treatment of AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in numerous areas. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The aim of this study was to compare 4 types of interventions, physical exercise (PE), music therapy (MT), computerized cognitive training (CCT), and NT, in older adults with mild to moderate AD or MCI and identify the most effective intervention for their cognitive function. We used a system of search strategies to identify relevant studies and include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of 4 interventions in patients with AD or MCI. We updated the relevant studies which were published before March 2017 as a full-text article. Using Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA), we ranked cognitive ability based objectively on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and assessed neuropsychiatric symptoms based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Pairwise and network meta-analyses were sequentially performed for efficacy and safety of intervention compared to control group through RCTs included. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We included 17 RCTs. Fifteen trials (n=1747) were pooled for cognition and no obvious heterogeneity was found (I 2 =21.7%, P=.212) in NMA, the mean difference (MD) of PE (MD=2.1, confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-3.8) revealed that PE was significantly efficacious in the treatment group in terms of MMSE. Five trials (n=660) assessed neuropsychiatric symptoms with an obvious heterogeneity (I 2 =61.6%, P=.034), the MD of CCT (MD=-7.7, CI: -14 to -2.4), revealing that CCT was significantly efficacious in NPI. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): As the first NMA comparing different interventions for AD and MCI, our study suggests that PE and CCT might have a significant improvement in cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms respectively. Moreover, nonpharmacological therapies might be better than pharmacological therapies.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 the Author(s).

N2  - Aim: This study aims to investigate the effects of a combined ther apy comprising a combination of computer-based cognitive rehabilitation with traditional rehabilitation techniques on cognitive functions in post-stroke patients suffering from a mild-to-moderate degree of cognitive impairment and to compare the results with a group of patients not receiving such ther apy. <ovid:br/>Method(s): 33 post-stroke patients fulfilling exclusion/inclusion criteria were allocated according to travel distance from the treatment centre to either the treatment (N = 19) or control group (N = 14). Cognitive rehabilitation was performed in 60-min-long sessions held twice a week for 12 weeks. Mini - Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Addenbrook Cognitive Examination - Revised (ACER) tests were performed at the beginning of the treatment, retests were performed approximately 16 weeks later and the results, including ACE-R subscores assecondary endpoints, were analysed. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In the treatment group, statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) was detected in MMSE, ACE-R, and in ACE-Rsubtests Memory, Verbal fluency and Language, while only the Memory subtest recorded statistically significant improvement in the control group. However, due to the small number of patients, we only present the results as trends indicating that a study on a larger cohort is needed. Hence, a sample size for a future study required for proper assessment of the effects of combined approach cognitive rehabilitation was calculated, the resulting group size is 334 patients. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): A combination of computer-based rehabilitation and traditional rehabilitation techniques in patients suffering from mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment as a result of stroke led to a statistical ly significant improvement in MMSE and ACE-R tests and in ACE-R Memory, Verbal fluency and Language subtests. However, due to a small number of patients, we only present these results as trends.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Czech Medical Association J.E. Purkyne. All rights reserved.

N2  - This study examined whether standard cognitive training, tailored cognitive training, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), standard cognitive training + tDCS, or tailored cognitive training + tDCS improved cognitive function and functional outcomes in participants with PD and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). Forty-two participants with PD-MCI were randomized to one of six groups: (1) standard cognitive training, (2) tailored cognitive training, (3) tDCS, (4) standard cognitive training + tDCS, (5) tailored cognitive training + tDCS, or (6) a control group. Interventions lasted 4 weeks, with cognitive and functional outcomes measured at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR: 12614001039673). While controlling for moderator variables, Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) showed that when compared to the control group, the intervention groups demonstrated variable statistically significant improvements across executive function, attention/working memory, memory, language, activities of daily living (ADL), and quality of life (QOL; Hedge's g range = 0.01 to 1.75). More outcomes improved for the groups that received standard or tailored cognitive training combined with tDCS. Participants with PD-MCI receiving cognitive training (standard or tailored) or tDCS demonstrated significant improvements on cognitive and functional outcomes, and combining these interventions provided greater therapeutic effects.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Blake J.

N2  - Objective: this study examined the prevalence of depression and anxiety as well as the relationship to cognitive functioning in the sub-acute phase and at 2 months post-stroke in a sample of 40 inpatients. This study also explored the relationship between anxiety, depression and the side of lesions caused by stoke. In addition, efficacy of neuropsychological intervention on anxiety, depression and cognitive functioning was evaluated. <ovid:br/>Method(s): a convenience sample of 40 post-stroke patients was recruited from an inpatient rehabilitation unit. They completed the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Verbal Memory Span and Visuospatial Memory Span, the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrix (RCPM), the Guidelines for the Rating of Awareness Deficits (GRAD), the Clinical Insight Rating Scale (CIRS), the Hamilton Rating Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) in the subacute phase (T1) and 2 months after stroke (T2). Medical information about the stroke and its characteristics was provided. A control sample of 21 orthopaedic patients was enrolled to compare anxiety, depression and the efficacy of treatment. A correlational analysis was performed to examine the relationships between anxiety, depression, and cognitive functioning in the sample of post-stroke patients. <ovid:br/>Result(s): results showed significant differences between the post-stroke sample and control sample in anxiety and depression. There were no significant differences in anxiety and depression between patients with left and right hemisphere lesions. In addition, neuropsychological intervention was effective on anxiety and cognitive functioning but not on depression. Results of correlational analysis showed specific and significant associations between anxiety, depression and cognitive functioning. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): the findings suggest that it is important to focus on anxiety and depression in post- stroke patients in order to specifically guide rehabilitation procedures in the different stages of stroke. Psychological support for depression in addition to neuropsychological intervention is important in the early post-stroke stage.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Giovanni Fioriti Editore s.r.l.

N2  - Purpose: Cognitive decline after stroke is highly associated with functional disability. Empirical evidence shows that exercise combined cognitive training may induce neuroplastic changes that modulate cognitive function. However, it is unclear whether hybridized exercise-cognitive training can facilitate cortical activity and physiological outcome measures and further influence on the cognitive function after stroke. This study will investigate the effects of two hybridized exercise-cognitive trainings on brain plasticity, physiological biomarkers and behavioral outcomes in stroke survivors with cognitive decline. Methods and significance: This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A target sample size of 75 participants is needed to obtain a statistical power of 95% with a significance level of 5%. Stroke survivors with mild cognitive decline will be stratified by Mini-Mental State Examination scores and then randomized 1:1:1 to sequential exercise-cognitive training, dual-task exercise-cognitive training or control groups. All groups will undergo training 60 min/day, 3 days/week, for a total of 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the resting-state functional connectivity and neural activation in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes in functional magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes include physiological biomarkers, cognitive functions, physical function, daily functions and quality of life. This study may differentiate the effects of two hybridized trainings on cognitive function and health-related conditions and detect appropriate neurological and physiological indices to predict training effects. This study capitalizes on the groundwork for a non-pharmacological intervention of cognitive decline after stroke.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018

N2  - Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive newly developed technique and it is applying various neurologic disease for improving neural circuit integrity and activity. We investigated the therapeutic effect of rTMS with cognitive training (rTMS-CT) compared with those of sham group in dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We recruited mild Alzheimer's dementia (AD) patients who were diagnosed by DSM-IV. All participants did MRI scans for marking target location of rTMS by the navigation system and to exclude other brain structural lesions. rTMS applied on six cortical areas (both dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal somatosensory associated cortices, Broca's and Wernicke's areas) with 10Hz, 90~110% of motor threshold intensities during 6 weeks (5 days per week, total 30 sessions). Various levels of cognitive trainings consisted of compatible cognitive tasks with each stimulated cortical area applied just after rTMS. Participants were tested 3 times of neuropsychological tests (ADAS-cog, MMSE, and geriatric depression scale); pre-treatment, immediate post-treatment, and 6 weeks after post-treatment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The patients treated with rTMS-CT showed significant cognitive improvement than those of sham group. The cognitive function assessed by ADAS-cog improved significantly after rTMS-CT in 6 weeks and 12 weeks compared with the baseline cognitive function. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): rTMS-CT for modulating neural circuits integrity might be an effective complementary therapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in dementia.

T1  - Determinants of care refusal: From patients suffering from dementia to their caregivers characteristics

N2  - Backgrounds: Neuropsychologists and medical staff members of memory clinics receive patients to diagnose dementia and provide advice to their caregivers. The caregivers are often family members, spouses or children. They are involved in the care and consequently frequently suffer from deteriorating health conditions. They are exposed to an increased risk of various pathologies compared to matched population that are not involved in the care of a family member. During the follow-up, we are often disappointed by critical situations that could have been prevented through professional support. Various reasons are known as potentially involved in this care refusal. Denial, a lack of consciousness of the risks or misidentification of the need for help could also be involved. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): Our main goal was to understand which parameters influenced the decision of the patients and their caregivers when they choose to refuse or apply some recommended actions (professional support offered by a nurse for example, cognitive stimulation). We decided to study socio-demographic and cognitive characteristics of patients suffering from dementia involved in this choice. We have also studied the caregivers' characteristics to specify our hypothesis on features influencing help refusal or acceptance. <ovid:br/>Method(s): all consecutive patients consulting in the memory clinic were enrolled in the study. The patients did not have any previous examination in a memory clinic or diagnosis of dementia. The diagnosis was established following classical medical and neuropsychological examinations, using valid and recent cognitive tools. A specific questionnaire was then assessed, gathering data concerning existing help and suggested recommendation provided by the medical practitioner and the neuropsychologist. The patients and the caregivers were both provided advice. A letter was sent to the attending physician to ensure the understanding and continuity in the care. During the follow-up, we checked data concerning acceptance or refusal of our previous provided advices. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to study the influence of the patients and their caregivers' characteristics on decision to apply or refuse recommendations. <ovid:br/>Result(s): only few specific features were found to significantly influence refusal or acceptance of recommended actions. As an example, the status of the caregivers, i.e. being children versus spouses, increased acceptance of nurse. On the other hand, a low MMSe score resulted in an increased acceptance of participation in groups for memory stimulation. Other variables are presented and their influence discussed, as the patients' aged that seems to have no influence in the final decision to accept or refuse help. The cost of the professional intervention does not seem to be engaged in the process of decision. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): the psychological or emotional determinants of recommendation acceptance are difficult to understand. However, it is challenging for the professional members of memory centers, as this support might contribute to a more effective care of the patients. It might also decrease the health worsening and the negative impact on their caregivers. Through the cognitive and socio-demographical study of our study sample, we were able to specify some features influencing the choice in help or support use. We need now to conduct more detailed analysis concerning the potential effect of the advice repetition. In fact, it should be interesting to determine if some time is needed through the follow-up to influence the patients and their caregivers' decision or if only intrapersonal features are involved in such cognitive processes.

N2  - Background: Memory self-efficacy is the belief that one will be able to succeed in a memory task. This belief may protect older adults against harmful aging stereotypes and to motivate them to practice memory skills and learn new memory strategies. While it is widely known that older adults differ in their memory self-efficacy, personal characteristics that might influence one's self-efficacy are not well understood. The present study aims to characterize levels of memory self-efficacy utilizing baseline data from the Senior WISE Memory Training Intervention. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In a triethnic sample of older adults (N=252) aged 50 and older, memory self-efficacy was measured using Memory Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (MSEQ). Predictors included demographic variables (age, education, sex, black, Hispanic, self-reported general health), cognitive variables (Trails B, COWAT, Rivermead SPS, BVMT Total Recall, HVLT Total Recall, MMSE), and mental health variables (CESD, self-reported mental health). <ovid:br/>Result(s): Using hierarchical multivariate regression analyses we found that older age was associated with poorer memory self-efficacy (B=-.20, p=.001) and the greater general health was associated with better memory self-efficacy (B=.21, p=.001). Next, better verbal memory was marginally associated with better memory self-efficacy (B=.15, p=.07). In the final analysis, better self-reported mental health was associated with poorer memory self-efficacy (B=-.14, p=.087). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These findings are consistent with the "rich get richer" notion that people more well off often benefit most from interventions. On the other hand, people low in these characteristics might be targeted to improve their memory self-efficacy first, followed by any substantial memory intervention to be most effective.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018

N2  - Background: A major gap exists in providing care to support and maintain functional and social independence of older people with dementia at home. Our interdisciplinary Home-bAsed Reablement Program (I-HARP) integrates evidence-based strategies and cognitive rehabilitation into a dementia-specific person-centred, time limited, home-based, interdisciplinary rehabilitation package. We conducted a parallel-group pilot RCT of I-HARP with community-dwelling people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild to moderate stages of dementia to test feasibility and potential effects of I-HARP in Sydney, Australia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): I-HARP involved up to 10 home visits by Occupational Therapist, Registered Nurse, plus additional options of other allied-health support, tailored to the individual client's needs; up to A$1000 home modification/assistive devices; and individual carer support, all provided over 4 months. Assessments of the client's daily activities, mobility and health-related quality of life, as well as caregiver burden and quality of life were conducted at baseline, 4 months (post-intervention) and 12 months from baseline. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Eighteen dyads were randomized equally into the two groups using a computer program. Clients were: aged 64-91 years, with MMSE ranging between 16-30, ten were female, nine had Alzheimer's disease, seven with other types of dementia, and two had amnestic MCI. At 12 months, the intervention group showed a decline in functional independence (ADL/IADL) using the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) of 6.63 while the control group had a decline of 12.06, a difference of 5.43 (SD 16.90), giving an effect size of 0.32. Three of the control group clients were placed into care homes while all of the intervention clients were still living at home at 12 months. Interviews with carers and field notes suggested a strong endorsement of I-HARP, and carers' observation of the person becoming more independent and socially engaged as a result of I-HARP. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our pilot trial demonstrated that I-HARP enhances functioning of people with dementia, and improves their mobility, independence, and observed wellbeing and confidence, enabling them to live at home for significantly longer. The results also point to the benefit of an interdisciplinary team as having the maximum impact. An improved larger scale trial of I-HARP is underway.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018

N2  - Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a potential novel strategy for cognitive enhancement in patients with major or minor neurocognitive disorders, but stimulation protocols have not been optimized yet. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A parallel, prospective, patients and raters blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial was conducted. Patients in the active arm received tDCS (anodal; F3, cathodal; Fp2, 2A, 20 min) twice a day for 5 consecutive days. Calculation and reading tasks were conducted for 20 min during the stimulation. Primary outcome was attrition rate in the intervention group during the trial, which is expected to be less than 10%. Secondary outcomes were mean difference of improvement (positive means improvement) between groups in changes of mini mental state examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's disease assessment scale- cognitive (ADAS-Cog), frontal assessment battery (FAB), and clinical dementia rating (CDR) from baseline to day 5 and follow-up (two weeks after the final intervention). <ovid:br/>Result(s): 21 individuals agreed to participation in this trial and were screened at baseline. One participant withdraw consent to participation before randomization. After randomization, one participant in the sham group did it during the trial. Finally, 19 participants (7 in the active group and 12 in the sham group) finished the trial. No participants stopped the trial in the active group. No statistically significant difference was found in baseline characteristics between the groups. Mean difference of improvement between groups in changes of MMSE, ADAS-Cog and FAB at day 5 from baseline was 0.41 (p= 0.705), 1.61 (p= 0.205), -2.27 (p= 0.233) respectively. Mean difference of improvement between groupsin changes of MMSE, ADAS-Cog, FAB, and CDR at follow-up from baseline was 1.08 (p= 0.352), 0.36 (p= 0.791), -3.01 (p= 0.083), 0.06 (p= 0.404) respectively. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): tDCS is a safe and feasible technique in elderly patients with neurocognitive disorders. Future large-scale, well-designed randomized controlled trials will evaluate the effects of tDCS in those disorders more precisely.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018

N2  - Background: Despite increasing evidence for the benefits of cognitive training in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; Li et al., 2011; Mewborn et al., 2017), relatively little work has examined direct measures of training-induced neural changes. Event-related electroencephalography (EEG) offers temporally sensitive measures of neural functioning and has been shown to be useful in evaluating benefits of cognitive training in older adults (Kuper et al., 2017). Only one study thus far has examined cognitive training outcomes using event-related EEG in MCI (Chan et al., 2016), suggesting a need for further studies. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Thirty-two older adults with aMCI assigned to either a strategy-based Gist Reasoning training (n=16) or a fact-based New Learning training (n=16) served as participants. The training groups were comparable in age, sex, and education, and on scores for Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating, and Logical Memory immediate and delayed subtests of Wechsler Memory Scale-III. Both groups received a total of 8 hours of training over a 4-week period. EEG was recorded both pre- and post-training while participants completed two Go/NoGo tasks involving basic and superordinate semantic categorization. Effects of training group on pre-post assessment of task-related behavioral measures (reaction times and accuracy) and event-related neural oscillations, namely power in the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (14-30 Hz) bands, were examined. <ovid:br/>Result(s): No between group differences were observed pre- or post-training on task-related behavioral measures. Event-related neural oscillations revealed significant group differences post-training in the alpha and beta bands. The Gist Reasoning group showed enhanced event-related desynchronization for low-frequency alpha (8-10 Hz) and beta on NoGo trials and for high-frequency alpha (11-13 Hz) and beta on Go trials during superordinate categorization, compared to the New Learning group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Gist Reasoning training impacted neural processing in individuals with aMCI, suggesting that training programs that target higher-order reasoning functions can exploit the neuroplastic potential of the brain. Furthermore, event-related neural oscillations can serve as useful outcome measures of training-induced neural changes.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018

N2  - Background: We studied the efficacy of regulated cognitive training in the neuropsychological function of elderly people and whether Subjective Memory Complains (SMC) could be mitigated by it. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A prospective, longitudinal study was carried out in 101 elderly subjects (66.3% female, mean age 71.5 years) 49 of them SMC (Abdulrab and Heun 2008 criteria) and 52 healthy elderly (HE). We performed a neuropsychological assessment including memory, language, attention, praxis and executive function, assessed by the following tests: Logical Memory, Word List and Digits forwards and backwards of the Wechsler Memory Scale - Third Edition, Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, 7 Minute Screen Test, Rey-Osterrieth Simple Figure, Trail Making Test, Forms A and B, phonological and semantic verbal fluency. In addition, we administered a Mini Mental State Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Functional Activities Questionnaire, level of occupation and the cognitive reserve questionnaire. The whole group were randomized to receive (n=48; 23 SMC, 25 HE) or not (53; 26 SMC, 27 HE) cognitive training. The training programme was administered in an experienced center within our community and consists of 30 sessions that last an hour and a half, 28 of them are carried out within three months and two more as maintaining sessions. Each session is structured with its objectives, materials and specific activities and begins with 15 minutes of relaxation and organized in groups of 14-16 persons each. The neuropsychological battery was repeated in 6 months. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In the Paired Sample T Test, multiple variables (GDS, memory, phonological and semantic verbal fluency, executive functions and 7 min screen test) showed improvement in the training group versus control. There were no changes in subjective functionality scales. In Linear Regression only GDS (B=-0.56; 95%CI=-1.13- -0.01; p=0.05), failures of everyday memory (B=-2.81; 95%CI=-5.04-0.57; p=0.015), immediate units of total logical memory (B=3.44; 95%CI=0.36-6.51; p=0.029), logical text B first memory (B=2.20; 95%CI=0.83-3.57; p=0.002) and S verbal fluency (B=1.43; 95%CI=0.08-2.78; p=0.038), showed significance. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In our study we found that a regulated training administered in an experienced center on healthy subjects and patients with SMC consistently improves aspects of memory and language, subjectively improving the patient's compliance with his problem but without changing subjective functionality.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018

N2  - Background: Deficits in memory performance are often nonspecific predictors of cognitive decline and may portend a future diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). <ovid:br/>Method(s): This study had 2 aims: (1) identify participants who might have MCI and (2) evaluate how this subgroup of participants fared over the 24 months in this longitudinal randomized trial. MCI was defined as a subjective change in cognition, impairment in episodic memory, preservation of independence of functional abilities, and not demented. Participants were assigned to 12 hours of either memory or health training. The Senior WISE intervention was derived from Bandura's self-efficacy theory and provided a unique package of cognitive skill development. The memory-training intervention consisted of 4 components: stress inoculation, health promotion, memory self-efficacy, and memory strategy training. The control group received 18 hours of health training. Of the 263 total participants, 39 met the criteria for MCI. The sample was 79% females, 71% Caucasian, 17% Hispanic, and 12% African American with an average age of 75 years and an average education level of 13 years. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were 19 adults in the memory training and 20 in the health training conditions. Compared with the normal group, the MCI group was younger, was more likely to be African American, was more depressed, had lower MMSE and episodic memory scores, reported more memory complaints, and had lower scores of daily functioning. Over 24 months, the MCI group in the memory training condition showed better objective and subjective memory outcomes compared with the health training condition. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Memory training delivered in small groups was a robust mechanism to reduce the negative consequences of declining cognitive ability in persons with MCI and sustain the benefit over 2 years in both subjective and objective memory function.

N2  - Background No large trials have been done to investigate the efficacy of an intervention combining a specific compound and several lifestyle interventions compared with placebo for the prevention of cognitive decline. We tested the effect of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation and a multidomain intervention (physical activity, cognitive training, and nutritional advice), alone or in combination, compared with placebo, on cognitive decline. Methods The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial was a 3-year, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial with four parallel groups at 13 memory centres in France and Monaco. Participants were non-demented, aged 70 years or older, and community-dwelling, and had either relayed a spontaneous memory complaint to their physician, limitations in one instrumental activity of daily living, or slow gait speed. They were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to either the multidomain intervention (43 group sessions integrating cognitive training, physical activity, and nutrition, and three preventive consultations) plus omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ie, two capsules a day providing a total daily dose of 800 mg docosahexaenoic acid and 225 mg eicosapentaenoic acid), the multidomain intervention plus placebo, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids alone, or placebo alone. A computer-generated randomisation procedure was used to stratify patients by centre. All participants and study staff were blinded to polyunsaturated fatty acid or placebo assignment, but were unblinded to the multidomain intervention component. Assessment of cognitive outcomes was done by independent neuropsychologists blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was change from baseline to 36 months on a composite Z score combining four cognitive tests (free and total recall of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding test, ten Mini-Mental State Examination orientation items, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, and Category Naming Test) in the modified intention-to-treat population. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00672685). Findings 1680 participants were enrolled and randomly allocated between May 30, 2008, and Feb 24, 2011. In the modified intention-to-treat population (n=1525), there were no significant differences in 3-year cognitive decline between any of the three intervention groups and the placebo group. Between-group differences compared with placebo were 0.093 (95% CI 0.001 to 0.184; adjusted p=0.142) for the combined intervention group, 0.079 (-0.012 to 0.170; 0.179) for the multidomain intervention plus placebo group, and 0.011 (-0.081 to 0.103; 0.812) for the omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids group. 146 (36%) participants in the multidomain plus polyunsaturated fatty acids group, 142 (34%) in the multidomain plus placebo group, 134 (33%) in the polyunsaturated fatty acids group, and 133 (32%) in the placebo group had at least one serious emerging adverse event. Four treatment-related deaths were recorded (two in the multidomain plus placebo group and two in the placebo group). The interventions did not raise any safety concerns and there were no differences between groups in serious or other adverse events. Interpretation The multidomain intervention and polyunsaturated fatty acids, either alone or in combination, had no significant effects on cognitive decline over 3 years in elderly people with memory complaints. An effective multidomain intervention strategy to prevent or delay cognitive impairment and the target population remain to be determined, particularly in real-world settings.

N2  - AKTIVA-MCI is a program for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that aims to enhance participation in cognitively stimulating leisure activities. Participation in cognitively stimulating activities seems to be a potential strategy for people with MCI delaying cognitive decline for a while. In total, 35 MCI patients were enrolled in the pilot study of whom 29 completed the whole program (16 female, 71.1+/-7.5 years; Mini Mental Status Examination score: 28+/-2.2). Daily activity protocols were used to measure the frequency of participation in cognitively stimulating activities during the program (12 sessions). Additional standardized psychometric tests and questionnaires were used to assess cognition, mood, and subjective memory decline. Analyses of the daily activity protocols showed that during the intervention participants increased the frequency of several cognitively stimulating leisure activities. Comparison of pre-post data indicates no changes in cognitive status, mood, and subjective memory decline. These findings indicate that the program is suitable for patients with MCI.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Tesky et al.

N2  - Background: Most research points to the 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene as the most recognizable genetic risk factor associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. It has been also suggested that the APOE 4 allele has a negative influence on cognitive functioning, which begins long before cognitive impairment becomes manifest. However, still, little is known about the APOE 4 interaction with cognitive intervention programs. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The main goal of this study was to explore whether there was a differential APOE genotype modulation effect after cognitive training in different domains, such as language comprehension, executive functions, and memory. Contrary to other studies, hippocampal volume was controlled for. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Fifty older adults (65 years; 30 women and 20 men) participated in a multi-domain cognitive training that involved 30 sessions taking place over 12 weeks. Half of the participants were APOE 4 carriers. The control group was matched in age, gender, normalized hippocampal volume, cognitive reserve, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Version. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The study revealed that there were consistent treatment benefits in complex sentence comprehension (noncanonical sentences and sentences with two propositions), a domain that was not directly trained, but only in the A POE 4 noncarrier group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Genetic profile modulates training outcomes in sentence comprehension.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Background: The ability to recognize emotional expression is essential for social interactions, adapting to the environment, and quality of life. Emotion recognition is impaired in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus rehabilitation of these skills has the potential to elicit significant benefits. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study sought to establish whether emotion recognition capacity could be rehabilitated in people with AD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Thirty-six participants with AD were assigned to one of three conditions: An experimental group (EG) that received 20 sessions of rehabilitation of emotion recognition and 20 sessions of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST), a control group (CG) that received 40 sessions of CST, and a treatment as usual group (TAU). <ovid:br/>Result(s): A positive treatment effect favoring the EG was found; participants were better able to correctly identify emotions (p=0.021), made fewer errors of commission (p=0.002), had greater precision of processing (p=0.021), and faster processing speed (p=0.001). Specifically, the EG were better able to identify sadness (p=0.016), disgust (p=0.005), and the neutral expression (p=0.014), with quicker processing speed for disgust (p=0.002). These gains were maintained at one month follow-up with the exception of processing speed for surprise, which improved. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Capacity to recognize facial expressions of emotions can be improved through specific rehabilitation in people with AD, and gains are still present at a one month follow up. These findings have implications for the design of rehabilitation techniques for people with AD that may lead to improved quality of life and social interactions for this population.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Background: Recent studies suggest that combined non-pharmacological interventions are more beneficial than single interventions for primary and secondary prevention of dementia. We previously reported enhanced effects of physical exercise with music (ExM) on cognitive function in normal elderly people compared to exercise alone. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To identify if ExM improves cognitive function and activities of daily livings (ADLs) in dementia patients over cognitive stimulation (CS). <ovid:br/>Method(s): We enrolled 85 patients with mild to moderate dementia. Forty-three subjects performed ExM developed by the Yamaha Music Foundation, and 42 subjects performed cognitive stimulation using portable game consoles and drills involving easy calculations, mazes, and mistake-searching in pictures. Interventions were performed once a week for 40 minutes. Before and after the six-month intervention, patients were assessed using neuropsychological batteries, and ADLs were assessed by patients' caregivers using the functional independence measure (FIM). Voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) was used to assess medial temporal lobe atrophy. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Twenty-three subjects dropped out during the intervention. Thirty-one patients from each group were analyzed. Post-intervention, both groups showed significantly improved visuospatial function. Significant benefits were observed in psychomotor speed or memory in the ExM or CS groups, respectively. FIM scores, reflecting ADLs, and VSRAD scores were significantly preserved in the ExM group, but significantly worsened in the CS group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): ExM produced greater positive effects on cognitive function and ADLs in patients with mild to moderate dementia than CS, excluding memory. Optimal interventions for dementia will likely be achieved by combining ExMand CS.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

N2  - We developed and evaluated the effect of Multimodal Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (MCET) consisting of cognitive training, cognitive stimulations, reality orientation, physical therapy, reminiscence therapy, and music therapy in combination in older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia. This study was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over study (two 8-week treatment phases separated by a 4-week wash-out period). Sixty-four participants with MCI or dementia whose Clinical Dementia Rating was 0.5 or 1 were randomized to the MCET group or the mock-therapy (placebo) group. Outcomes were measured at baseline, week 9, and week 21. Fifty-five patients completed the study. Mini-Mental State Examination (effect size = 0.47, p = 0.013) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (effect size = 0.35, p = 0.045) scores were significantly improved in the MCET compared with mock-therapy group. Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist frequency (effect size = 0.38, p = 0.046) and self-rated Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease (effect size = 0.39, p = 0.047) scores were significantly improved in the MCET compared with mock-therapy. MCET improved cognition, behavior, and quality of life in people with MCI or mild dementia more effectively than conventional cognitive enhancing activities did.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Background: Light interventions typically exert their mood-related effects during morning bright light exposures over several weeks. Evidence about immediate ambient room light effects on depressed individuals is still sparse. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The present study aimed at examining the acute effects of a single moderately bright room light exposure on mood, and behavioural and cardiac stress reactions of mildly depressed geriatric inpatients during a short cognitive stimulation and while resting. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Twenty-one inpatients were tested in a balanced cross-over design on 2 consecutive days under either conventional room light (standard light) or artificial sunlight conditions for 30 min. Room illumination was implemented with an artificial skylight, which perfectly imitated solar indoor illumination (e.g., cloudless sky and bright artificial sun). Light-induced changes of mood, heart rate, and heart rate variability were recorded while performing a perseveration test (acted as cognitive stimulation) twice. Additionally, light-related behaviour was observed during a resting period between the cognitive tests and various subjective ratings were obtained. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Compared to standard light, exposure to artificial sunlight had a subjective calming effect over time (p = 0.029) as well as decreased heart rate and increased vagal tone (root mean squared of successive inter-beat intervals), both under cognitive workload and in resting conditions. Effect sizes of reported cardiac reactions were large. Cognitive variables were not influenced by light. Additionally, under the higher corneal illuminance of the artificial sunlight, patients perceived stronger glare (p = 0.030) and kept their eyes closed for longer times (p = 0.033) during the resting period. However, patients did not avoid bright light exposure while resting but voluntarily stayed within the area directly lit by the artificial sun nearly all the time (97%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this study for the first time demonstrated immediate psychophysiological effects of a single, short room light exposure in mildly depressed geriatric inpatients during a short cognitive stimulation and while resting. The findings complement reported evidence on immediate alerting and mood-related effects of bright light exposures.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Background: Spaced retrieval training (SRT) is a nonpharmacological intervention for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia that trains the learning and retention of target information by recalling it over increasingly long intervals. We recently developed the Ubiquitous Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and Rehabilitation Training (USMART) program as a convenient, self-administered tablet-based SRT program. We also demonstrated the utility of USMART for improving memory in individuals with MCI through an open-label uncontrolled trial. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This study had an open-label, single-blind, randomized, controlled, two-period crossover design. Fifty patients with MCI were randomized into USMART-usual care and usual care-USMART treatment sequences. USMART was completed or usual care was provided biweekly over a 4-week treatment period with a 2-week washout period between treatment periods. Primary outcome measures included the Word List Memory Test, Word List Recall Test (WLRT), and Word List Recognition Test. Outcomes were measured at baseline, week 5, and week 11 by raters who were blinded to intervention type. An intention-to-treat analysis and linear mixed modeling were used. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 50 randomized participants, 41 completed the study (18% dropout rate). The USMART group had larger improvements in WLRT score (effect size = 0.49, p = 0.031) than the usual care group. There were no significant differences in other primary or secondary measures between the USMART and usual care groups. Moreover, no USMART-related adverse events were reported. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The 4-week USMART modestly improved information retrieval in older people with MCI, and was well accepted with minimal technical support. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01688128 . Registered 12 September 2012.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Cognitive training is effective in patients with mild cognitive impairment but does not typically address the motivational deficits associated with older populations with memory difficulties. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a randomized controlled trial of cognitive training using a novel memory game on an iPad in 42 patients with a diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment assigned to either the cognitive training (n = 21; 8 hours of gameplay over 4 weeks) or control (n = 21; clinic visits as usual) groups. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Significant time-by-pattern-by-group interactions were found for cognitive performance in terms of the number of errors made and trials needed on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Paired Associates Learning task (P = .044; P = .027). Significant time-by-group interactions were also found for the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Paired Associates Learning first trial memory score (P = .002), Mini-Mental State Examination (P = .036), the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (P = .032), and the Apathy Evaluation Scale (P = .026). Within-group comparisons revealed highly specific effects of cognitive training on episodic memory. The cognitive training group maintained high levels of enjoyment and motivation to continue after each hour of gameplay, with self-confidence and self-rated memory ability improving over time. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Episodic memory robustly improved in the cognitive training group. "Gamified" cognitive training may also enhance visuospatial abilities in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Gamification maximizes engagement with cognitive training by increasing motivation and could complement pharmacological treatments for amnestic mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease. Larger, more controlled trials are needed to replicate and extend these findings.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author 2017.

N2  - Background: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is defined as impaired ability to attend and see on one side, and when present, it interferes seriously with daily life. These symptoms can exist for near and far spaces combined or independently, and it is important to provide effective intervention for near and far space neglect. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The purpose of this pilot study was to propose an immersive virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation program using a head-mounted display that is able to train both near and far space neglect, and to validate the immediate effect of the VR program in both near and far space neglect. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Ten USN patients underwent the VR program with a pre-post design and no control. In the virtual environment, we developed visual searching and reaching tasks using an immersive VR system. Behavioral inattention test (BIT) scores obtained pre- and immediate post-VR program were compared. <ovid:br/>Result(s): BIT scores obtained pre- and post-VR program revealed that far space neglect but not near space neglect improved promptly after the VR program. This effect for far space neglect was observed in the cancelation task, but not in the line bisection task. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Positive effects of the immersive VR program for far space neglect are suggested by the results of the present pilot study. However, further studies with rigorous designs are needed to validate its clinical effectiveness.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Informa UK Limited.

N2  - Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of rehabilitation involving group and personal sessions on demented participants. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This single-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 elderly participants with dementia in a geriatric health service facility, or R oken. Staff members, who did not participate in the intervention, examined cognitive function, mood, communication ability, severity of dementia, objective quality of life, vitality, and daily behaviour. After a baseline assessment, participants were randomly divided into three groups: (i) group intervention; (ii) personal intervention; and (iii) control. The 1-h group intervention (3-5 subjects) and 20-min personal intervention (one staff member per participant) were performed twice a week for 12 weeks (24 total sessions). The cognitive rehabilitation programme consisted of reminiscence, reality orientation, and physical exercise, and it was based on five principles of brain-activating rehabilitation; (i) pleasant atmosphere; (ii) communication; (iii) social roles; (iv) praising; and (v) errorless support. Data were analyzed after the second assessment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Outcome measures were analyzed in 43 participants-14 in the control group, 13 in group intervention, and 16 in personal intervention. Repeated measure ancova showed a significant interaction for cognitive function score (Mini-Mental State Examination) between group intervention and controls (F = 5.535, P = 0.029). In the post-hoc analysis, group intervention showed significant improvement (P = 0.016). Global severity of dementia tended to improve (P = 0.094) in group intervention compared to control (Mann-Whitney U -test). There were no significant interactions or improvements for other measurements. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Group rehabilitation for dementia is more effective for improving cognitive function and global severity of dementia than personal rehabilitation in Roken.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society

N2  - Executive functions are subject to a marked age-related decline, but have been shown to benefit from cognitive training interventions. As of yet, it is, however, still relatively unclear which neural mechanism can mediate training-related performance gains. In the present electrophysiological study, we examined the effects of multi-domain cognitive training on performance in an untrained cue-based task switch paradigm featuring Stroop color words: participants either had to indicate the word meaning of Stroop stimuli (word task) or perform the more difficult task of color naming (color task). One-hundred and three older adults (>65 years old) were randomly assigned to a training group receiving a 4-month multi-domain cognitive training, a passive no-contact control group or an active (social) control group receiving a 4-month relaxation training. For all groups, we recorded performance and EEG measures before and after the intervention. For the cognitive training group, but not for the two control groups, we observed an increase in response accuracy at posttest, irrespective of task and trial type. No training-related effects on reaction times were found. Cognitive training was also associated with an overall increase in N2 amplitude and a decrease of P2 latency on single trials. Training-related performance gains were thus likely mediated by an enhancement of response selection and improved access to relevant stimulus-response mappings. Additionally, cognitive training was associated with an amplitude decrease in the time window of the target-locked P3 at fronto-central electrodes. An increase in the switch positivity during advance task preparation emerged after both cognitive and relaxation training. Training-related behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) effects were not modulated by task difficulty. The data suggest that cognitive training increased slow negative potentials during target processing which enhanced the N2 and reduced a subsequent P3-like component on both switch and non-switch trials and irrespective of task difficulty. Our findings further corroborate the effectiveness of multi-domain cognitive training in older adults and indicate that ERPs can be instrumental in uncovering the neural processes underlying training-related performance gains.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Kuper, Gajewski, Frieg and Falkenstein.

N2  - Introduction Cognitive training improves cognitive performance and delays functional impairment, but its effects on dementia are not known. We examined whether three different types of cognitive training lowered the risk of dementia across 10 years of follow-up relative to control and if greater number of training sessions attended was associated with lower dementia risk. Methods The Advanced Cognitive Training in Vital Elderly (NCT00298558) study was a randomized controlled trial (N = 2802) among initially healthy older adults, which examined the efficacy of three cognitive training programs (memory, reasoning, or speed of processing) relative to a no-contact control condition. Up to 10 training sessions were delivered over 6 weeks with up to four sessions of booster training delivered at 11 months and a second set of up to four booster sessions at 35 months. Outcome assessments were taken immediately after intervention and at intervals over 10 years. Dementia was defined using a combination of interview- and performance-based methods. Results A total of 260 cases of dementia were identified during the follow-up. Speed training resulted in reduced risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.998, P =.049) compared to control, but memory and reasoning training did not (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.11, P =.177 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56-1.10, P =.163, respectively). Each additional speed training session was associated with a 10% lower hazard for dementia (unadjusted HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.95, P <.001). Discussion Initially, healthy older adults randomized to speed of processing cognitive training had a 29% reduction in their risk of dementia after 10 years of follow-up compared to the untreated control group.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 The Authors

N2  - Introduction: One of the positive effects of brain stimulation is interhemispheric modulation as shown in some scientific studies. This study examined if a type of noninvasive stimulation using binaural beats with led-lights and sound would show different modulatory effects upon Alfa and SMR brain waves of elderlies and children with some disease types. Subjects: The sample included 75 individuals of both genders, being, randomly, divided in 6 groups. Groups were named elderly without dementia diagnosis (EWD), n=15, 76+/-8 years, elderly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (EDP), n=15, 72+/-7 years, elderly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (EDA), n=15, 81+/-6 years. The other groups were named children with Autism (CA), n=10, 11+/-4 years, children with Intellectual Impairment (CII), n=10, 12 +/-5 years and children with normal cognitive development (CND), n=10, 11+/-4 years. Instruments and procedure: Instruments were the Mini Mental State Examination Test (MMSE), EEG-Neurocomputer instrument for brain waves registration, brain stimulator, Digit Span Test and a Protocol for working memory training. Data collection followed a pre and post-conjugated stimulation version. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The results of the inferential statistics showed that the stimulation protocol had different effects on Alpha and SMR brain waves of the patients. Also, indicated gains in memory functions, for both, children and elderlies as related to gains in brain waves modulation. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results may receive and provide support to a range of studies examining brain modulation and synaptic plasticity. Also, it was emphasized in the results discussion that there was the possibility of the technique serving as an accessory instrument to alternative brain therapies.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Calomeni et al.

N2  - Background and aims: An innovative cognitive intervention group program is required for patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to the lack of pharmaceutical treatments. The "Train Your Brain" (TYB) cognitive intervention group program customized for Singaporean patients to remediate cognitive impairments in patients with MCI. In this pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of TYB program. <ovid:br/>Method(s): 17 MCI patients aged>=50 years old were recruited from the memory clinic at National University Hospital, Singapore. A randomized control trial with cross-over design is adopted. The TYB group will attend a 9-session group program on brain health and cognitive training. The control group willbe waitlisted initially and crossed over to become an intervention group. All patients received pre/postmeasures of cognition [Mini-Mental State Exam and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as well as a formal neurocognitive battery], psychological wellbeing, memory self-efficacy and daily functioning. Two samples t-tests will be employed to compare change in measures between groups. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Approximately 2/3 of the patients could complete the whole TYB program. They have provided positive feedback such as improved self-efficacy and less anxiety pertaining tomemory problems. Despite the small sample size, significant improvement in MoCA has been observed (pre-program: 22.5+/-4.4 vs post-program: 23.7+/-4.0, p = .04). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our pilot study has demonstrated preliminary evidence for feasibility and efficacy of TYB program as a culturally and linguistically appropriate for MCI patients in Singapore. Data collection is ongoing. The change scores in formal neuropsychological tests and psychological wellbeing will be discussed.

N2  - Background: Computerised cognitive training (CCT) is a safe and scalable intervention with established efficacy in healthy older adults and those with mild cognitive impairment. However, it is unclear whether CCT can reverse cognitive trajectories in people with an insidious course of cognitive decline, a population at ultra-high risk for developing dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Eighty-six memory clinic patients with documented cognitive decline (at least 0.5 SD decline in memory performance between two follow-ups) are currently recruited to a randomised, active controlled trial. Participants are randomly assigned to either supervised, multidomain, intensive CCT for three months (Phase A) followed by 15 months of monthly booster training (Phase B), or three months of active control intervention (Phase A) followed by three months of CCTand 12 months of no-contact follow-up (Phase B). The primary outcome is change in a memory composite. Neuropsychological assessments, daily functioning measures and sleep quality are assessed at baseline and the end of each phase. Additional secondary measures include multimodal neuroimaging, neuroeconomic decision-making and genetic predictors of response to training. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 42 potentially eligible participants (60 years of age or over and objective memory decline), eight to date underwent baseline assessments and commenced the trial (mean participants age=73.38 SD=5.18, mean MMSE=29 SD=0.93). Six participants have finished Phase A. Recruitment is ongoing. Specific recruitment and intervention methods will be discussed as well as interim efficacy data. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In older adults with documented cognitive decline, we hypothesise that long-term CCT will result in augmented cognitive and functional performance compared to short-term control intervention. Response phenotypes will provide key knowledge towards implementation of CCT in memory clinics.

N2  - Background: Growing ubiquity of AD coupled with lack of efficacious pharmacologic treatments to slow the associated incipient neurodegeneration has led to a shifting of focus toward prevention or risk reduction through lifestyle interventions. However, despite convincing evidence of neuroplasticity, there is a paucity of scientifically rigorous and ecologically relevant studies of brain training that effectively build cognitive reserve in middle-aged adults to protect against cognitive decline. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Sheba virtual reality (VR)-based cognitive-motor training is a novel intervention in which participants train on adaptive everyday tasks covering several cognitive domains in a virtual environment while walking on a treadmill. This experimental intervention, targeting middleaged adults with a family history of AD, is compared with two active (VR with no treadmill, treadmill with non-specific cognitive stimulation) and one passive (waitlist) control conditions in a single- blind, parallel group, randomized controlled design. Participants in active groups train for 45 min. twice/week for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes are changes in memory performance and cerebral blood flow (CBF; MRI arterial spin labeling) immediately following training and at 6 months. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Baseline (mean6SD) demographic, clinical and cognitive characteristics of the first 10 participants: age 57.4+/-7.2 years, education: 15.8+/-2.9 years, 4 female; MMSE 28.5+/-1.1. On SF36 health status scales (scale:0-100; 100=no disability), mean6SD ranged from 62.0+/-18.1 (energy/fatigue) to 95.0+/-8.2 (physical functioning). Memory scores: RAVLT Trial 1 6.8+/-1.9, Trial 5 11.2+/-2.4, Delayed recall: 10.2+/-3.2; Logical Memory I: 14.6+/-3.8, Logical Memory II: 13.6+/-4.1. Scores were within the normal range using accepted norms. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Non-pharmacologic training may be administered prior to symptom onset when prevention may be possible. An ecologically valid VR setting that mimics complex demands of everyday life may prove an ideal cognitive training environment that augments transfer. Though VR training has benefited clinical cohorts, benefit in asymptomatic high-risk individuals is relatively unknown. Further, CBF may be a key marker of cognitive benefits, as it has shown sensitivity to cognitive training in healthy seniors and hypoperfusion in individuals with AD family history. This trial may define a new prophylactic paradigm for AD, adaptable for home-based application in high risk individuals. By AAIC 2017 we anticipate demographic, cognitive and CBF data for 30 participants.

N2  - Background: FINGER is a randomized controlled trial (NCT01041989) that demonstrated beneficial effects on cognition for a 2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention (diet, exercise, cognitive training and vascular risk monitoring) compared to control (regular health advice). This study investigated whether sociodemographic factors, socioeconomic status, baseline cognition or cardiovascular factors influenced intervention effects on cognition. <ovid:br/>Method(s): FINGER targeted 1260 people aged 60-77 years from the general Finnish population who were at risk for cognitive impairment but without dementia or cognitive impairment. Selection was based on CAIDE Dementia Risk Score and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological test battery. These criteria selected individuals with risk factors for dementia and cognitive performance at themean level or slightly lower than expected for age. Primary outcome was change in cognition (Neuropsychological Test Battery z-score).Mixed-effects regression models were used to investigate whether participants' characteristics influenced intervention effects on cognition (intervention x time x characteristic interactions). <ovid:br/>Result(s): As reported previously, FINGER intervention had a significant beneficial effect on the primary outcome (p = 0.03). Sociodemographic factors (sex, age), socioeconomic status (education, household income), baseline cognition (MMSE score) and cardiovascular risk factors (BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting glucose, overall cardiovascular risk) aswell as cardiovascular comorbidity did not modify response to intervention (p-values for interaction > 0.05). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The FINGER multidomain lifestyle intervention was beneficial regardless of sociodemographic factors, socioeconomic status, baseline cognition and level of cardiovascular risk. This indicates that the selection of the target population was successful. Thus, our results suggest that the FINGER intervention can be targeted at a large elderly population with increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia.

N2  - Background: FINGER is a randomized controlled trial (NCT01041989) that demonstrated beneficial effects on cognition for a 2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention (diet, exercise, cognitive training and vascular risk monitoring) compared to control (regular health advice). This study investigated whether sociodemographic factors, socioeconomic status, baseline cognition or cardiovascular factors influenced intervention effects on cognition. <ovid:br/>Method(s): FINGER targeted 1260 people aged 60-77 years from the general Finnish population who were at risk for cognitive impairment but without dementia or cognitive impairment. Selection was based on CAIDE Dementia Risk Score and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological test battery. These criteria selected individuals with risk factors for dementia and cognitive performance at the mean level or slightly lower than expected for age. Primary outcome was change in cognition (Neuropsychological Test Battery z-score). Mixedeffects regression models were used to investigate whether participants' characteristics influenced intervention effects on cognition (intervention x time x characteristic interactions). <ovid:br/>Result(s): As reported previously, FINGER intervention had a significant beneficial effect on the primary outcome (p = 0.03). Sociodemographic factors (sex, age), socioeconomic status (education, household income), baseline cognition (MMSE score) and cardiovascular risk factors (BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting glucose, overall cardiovascular risk) as well as cardiovascular comorbidity did not modify response to intervention (p-values for interaction > 0.05). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The FINGER multidomain lifestyle intervention was beneficial regardless of sociodemographic factors, socioeconomic status, baseline cognition and level of cardiovascular risk. This indicates that the selection of the target population was successful. Thus, our results suggest that the FINGER intervention can be targeted at a large elderly population with increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia.

N2  - Background: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is regarded as both a risk state for dementia and an intermediate state between normal aging and dementia (Gauthier et al., 2006; Luis et al., 2003; De-Carli, 2003). There is no standard treatment for MCI. Regular participation in dance preserves cognition into old age (Katenstroth, 2010) and leisure activities which include dancing likewise reduce the risk for dementia (Verghese, 2003). Dance combines physical activity, social and emotional engagement, and cognitive stimulation all thought to maintain synaptic connections and plasticity. A structured modular ballroom dance program called "indak" or rhythm was designed by a multidisciplinary team using concepts of visualization, musicality exercise, improvisation and dance recall, and increasing complexity. Indak was pilot tested and showed compliance was good.We examined whether ballroom dancing could improve cognition. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This single-blinded (blind assessor) observational study was done on elderly diagnosed with MCI based on the Petersen criteria. We used Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Philippines (MoCA-P), Mini-Mental State Exam-Philippines (MMSE-P) for baseline and post-intervention assessment. The intervention consisted of one-hour dance sessions twice weekly for 12 months and conducted by professionally certified dance teachers. Paired t-tests were used to compare pre-and post-interventions scores, and unpaired t-test for comparing post-intervention scores between dancers and non-dancers. <ovid:br/>Result(s): All 207 Filipino elderly with MCI underwent baseline assessment. One hundred one vounteered to participate in the intervention. Baseline versus post-intervention scores showed the dancers' mean change improved in ADAS-Cog, MoCA-P and MMSE-P (3.1665.99, 0.9663.33, 0.8962.39 respectively) and all were significant (p<0.01). Among controls, only theMMSEsignificantly improved. When the post-intervention scores were compared between dancers and controls, the difference in the MoCA-P, Logical Memory and Boston Naming were likewise significant. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Indak is a 12-month ballroom dance program that is novel and effective yet relatively inexpensive non-pharmacological strategy to improve cognition among community-dwelling elderly Filipinos with MCI. Ballroom dance can then be studied in a randomized controlled trial, alone or as part of multidimensional intervention, to delay dementia onset or modify progression of MCI.

N2  - Background: Intervention effects to prevent cognitive decline in elderly were controversial. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): We examined whether cognitive training and physical exercise could prevent cognitive deterioration. Patients and Methods/Material and Methods: In a non-randomised controlled trial, we enrolled individuals aged 60-88 years recruited from outpatient clinic for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) at a geriatric hospital. Inclusion criteria were Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) Standard Profile Score <16, and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score >23. We assigned participants to four groups (A: cognitive training, B: physical exercise, C: combination intervention: cognitive training and physical exercise, D: control with general health advice). We assessed MMSE, RBMT, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Trail Making Test A (TMT-A) and Trail Making Test B (TMT-B), at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month later. Interventions were conducted in small groups once a week, where each session was 40 minutes up to 12 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed with linear mixed models using SPSS 22. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Thirty-four individuals were enrolled to this study. A: cognitive training group 7, B: physical exercise group 12, C: combination intervention 11, and D: control group 4 participants. Combination intervention group showed improvement of TMT-B score between baseline and post-intervention (p=0.036). No significant differences were found in other comparisons. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study suggests that a combination intervention (cognitive training and physical exercise) could improve or maintain cognitive functioning in MCI subjects.

N2  - Introduction: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) offers a range of activities, which provide general stimulation for thinking, con-centration, and memory, commonly in a social setting. This paper describes the effectiveness of CST on cognition and depressive symptoms in older adults in nursing homes (NHs). <ovid:br/>Method(s): A randomized controlled trial, carried out in 2016, included 100 residents from five NHs, 75 women and 25 men (randomized into experimental (n=49) and control groups (n=51)). Six participants dropped out (intention to treat (ITT) analysis and per protocol (PP) analysis were performed). During 7 weeks, par-ticipants of the experimental group underwent 14 CST sessions, and participants of the control group received usual care. The Mini-Mental State Examination, the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, were administered at baseline and postintervention. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Inferential statistics revealed that CST increased cognition in the experimental group (p<0.01; R2 (%) =58.82), although evidence of differences between groups in depressive symptoms was not found (p>0.05; R2 (%) =43.4). However, from a clinical point of view, in the experimental group there was evidence of depressive symptoms reduction (p<0.05), while there was no evidence reduction in the control group (p>0.05). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): CST had significantly improved cognition, with a moderate significant correlation, but there was no statistical evidence of its effectiveness on depressive symptoms. These results support the implementation of CST in NHs. Additionally CST may also have an important economic impact by reducing the costs of the impact of elders' cognitive frailty.

N2  - Introduction: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) offers a range of activities, which provide general stimulation. Evidence suggests that cognitive stimulation (CS) has a positive effect on cognition and depressive symptomatology (DS). This research aims to analyse the effectiveness of CST, on cognition and depressive symptoms in older adults in nursing homes (NHs) in different periods of time. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A randomized controlled trial will be developed in residents from five NHS. If required, "intention to treat" analysis and per protocol analysis will be performed. During 7 weeks, participants of the experimental group will participate in 14 CST sessions, and participants of the control group received usual care. Then during another seven weeks, participants of the experimental group will participate in 16 CST sessions (maintenance program), and participants of the control group still received usual care. The Mini-Mental State Examination, the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, will be administered at baseline, postintervention of the initial program, postintervention of the maintenance program and 3 months after the end of the program. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The present study will provide information on how effective the CST is over time. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study will bring evidence about CST's relevance in elders in NHs, guiding recommendation of CST in this context.

N2  - Aims Noninvasive brain stimulation with trains of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) can modulate activity in specific cortical brain region and networks, and thus affect cognitive function. The neuroADTM Therapy System delivers brain MRI neuro-navigated, focal TMS concurrently with Cognitive Training exercises. The Cognitive Training tasks are designed to engage the cognitive functions of the brain networks targeted by a preceding train of TMS. Method This pivotal, aimed to gain regulatory clearance (equivalent to pharmaceutical phase III study), randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 6 weeks course of daily neuroADTM Therapy in the treatment of cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer (NIA-AA criteria). In a multi-center study at 10 sites, 131 subjects were enrolled and randomized to neuroADTM versus sham (placebo). Participants were 60-90 years old, with MMSE 18-26, CDR 1-2, and on stable doses of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine (or un-medicated for AD). Informed Consent was obtained from all participants. All subjects had evaluation of ADAS-Cog and CGI-C baseline, week 7 and week 12. Enrolled patients were randomized to either Active or Sham treatment groups. Both Active and Sham interventions involved 30 daily sessions over six weeks. Each session was approximately one hour long. Results The pivotal, regulatory-targeted study is complete. The safety results will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion Study outcomes support an on-going FDA application for clearance of the neuroADTM Therapy System.

N2  - Aims We developed the Ubiquitous Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and Rehabilitation Training (USMART) program by transforming the face-to-face spaced retrieval-based memory training into the self-administered spaced retrieval-based memory training using an APP working on iPAD. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of the USMART in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Method This study was a randomized, controlled, two-period cross-over study (4 weeks of treatment separated by one wash-out period of 2 weeks). Fifty participants with MCI diagnosed by the International Working Group on MCI criteria were allocated to the active therapy (USMART) group or the control group, and 41 completed the study. Primary outcome measures were the Word List Memory Test (WLMT), Word List Recall test (WLRT) and Word List Recognition test (WLRcT). Secondary outcome measures were Subjective Memory Complaint Questionnaire (SMCQ), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). All measures were administered at baseline, week 5 and week 11. Results The USMART was more effective in improving the WLRT score (effect size 0.495, p=0.025), whereas no improvement was observed in the SMCQ, GDS and MMSE. Conclusion The results suggested that the USMART may be effective in improving memory function of the people with MCI.

N2  - Background: More and more patients in Japan are having major or minor cognitive disorders. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been reported to improve cognitive function in healthy subjects, but the effect of tDCS on cognitive function for patients with major cognitive disorder is not consistent among the studies. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of tDCS during cognitive rehabilitation on cognitive function for patients with major or minor cognitive disorders. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A parallel, randomized, sham-controlled design is applied for 55- 90 years old outpatients or inpatients diagnosed as major or minor neurocognitive disorder in DSM-5 in a single center, the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry. Participants, caregivers and raters are blinded to group assignment. Patricipants in the intervention group are receiving tDCS (anodal; F3, cathodal, Fp1, 2A, 20 min) twice a day for 5 consecutive days, while those in the control arm are taking sham-tDCS (anodal; F3, cathodal; Fp1, 2A, 40 sec) twice a day for the same period. Calculation task and reading task are conducted in both arms as a cognitive rehabilitation for 20 minutes during the stimulation (learning therapy). Patients with severe psychotic symptoms, severe depression, severe suicide ideation, or severe dementia with MMSE score of less than 18 points or Japanese version of Clnical Dementia Rating Scale(CDR-J) score of more than 3 points, are excluded. Participants are also excluded who could not safely conduct Electroconvulsive Therapy or tDCS or when they fails to score writing or drawing in mini mental state examination(MMSE). The primary outcome is dropout rate during the trial, which should not exceed 10% for safety reasons. Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale - cognition, MMSE, Frontal Assessment Battery, CDR-J or its sum of boxes are assessed as secondary outcomes. The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

N2  - Introduction: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is widely studied in fields of neurological and psychiatric disorders. It has been reported that rTMS with cognitive training could have some positive cognitive impacts on Alzheimer's disease (AD). The magnitude of cognitive improvement was pronounced, especially in the mild stage of AD on the previous study. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of rTMS with cognitive training to prove the therapeutic prognosis in more patients with mild AD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We recruited AD patients who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease by DSM-IV criteria from February, 2013 to June, 2016. All participants were undertaken brain MRIs for rTMS with specialized navigation system and structured neuropsychological assessment including ADAScog, MMSE, and geriatric depression scale(GDS). The rTMS protocols were configured for six cortical areas (both dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal somatosensory associated cortices and Broca's and Wernicke's areas; 10Hz, 90-110% intensity, and 5 days/week for 6 weeks). Neuropsychological assessments were performed before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after the end of treatment. All patients recruited in this study were taking cholinesterase inhibitors without changing dose during the study. <ovid:br/>Result(s): For comparison between the rTMS with cognitive training and sham groups, the patients treated with rTMS with cognitive training showed significant cognitive improvement than those of sham group. The cognitive function assessed by ADAS-cogimproved significantly after rTMS with cognitive training in 6w and 12w compared with the baseline cognitive function. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): rTMS with cognitive training could play an important adjuvant therapeutic role for mild AD patients who are taking cholinesterase inhibitors in the absence of curable remedy for AD.

N2  - This pilot study examined the functional impact of computerized versus compensatory calendar training in cognitive rehabilitation participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Fifty-seven participants with amnestic MCI completed randomly assigned calendar or computer training. A standard care control group was used for comparison. Measures of adherence, memory-based activities of daily living (mADLs), and self-efficacy were completed. The calendar training group demonstrated significant improvement in mADLs compared to controls, while the computer training group did not. Calendar training may be more effective in improving mADLs than computerized intervention. However, this study highlights how behavioral trials with fewer than 30-50 participants per arm are likely underpowered, resulting in seemingly null findings.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 by the authors.

N2  - Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of individually tailored cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for reducing depressive symptoms with or without anxiety poststroke. Design Multicenter, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Setting Ambulatory rehabilitation setting. Participants Patients who had a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale (HADS-D) score >7 at least 3 months poststroke (N=61). Interventions Participants were randomly allocated to either augmented CBT or computerized cognitive training (CCT). The CBT intervention was based on the principles of recognizing, registering, and altering negative thoughts and cognitions. CBT was augmented with goal-directed real-life activity training given by an occupational or movement therapist. Main Outcome Measures HADS-D was the primary outcome, and measures of participation and quality of life were secondary outcomes. Outcome measurements were performed at baseline, immediately posttreatment, and at 4- and 8-month follow-up. Analysis was performed with linear mixed models using group (CBT vs CCT) as the between-subjects factor and time (4 assessments) as the within-subjects factor. Results Mixed model analyses showed a significant and persistent time effect for HADS-D (mean difference, -4.6; 95% confidence interval, -5.7 to -3.6; P<.001) and for participation and quality of life in both groups. There was no significant group x time effect for any of the outcome measures. Conclusions Our augmented CBT intervention was not superior to CCT for the treatment of mood disorders after stroke. Future studies should determine whether both interventions are better than natural history.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine

N2  - Introduction Evidence is unclear whether cognitive training (CT) has efficacy in patients with dementia. We present the recruitment and baseline findings of a carefully designed Finnish cognitive training (FINCOG) trial exploring the effectiveness of CT among community-dwelling older persons with mild-to-moderate dementia. Methods Participants were recruited from adult day care centres in Helsinki, Finland, and randomised into two groups: (1) day care with systematic CT twice a week for 12 weeks (n = 76) and (2) day care as usual (n = 71). Demographics, diagnoses and drug use were retrieved from medical records, and baseline cognition, functioning, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychological well-being were assessed. A subgroup of participants was planned to undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure changes in brain activity. Feedback from those attending CT was collected. Primary trial outcomes will be participants' cognition and HRQoL. Results The mean (SD) age of the randomised participants was 83.1 (5.4) years, 72% were female and 37% at a moderate stage of dementia. The intervention and control groups were comparable at baseline. Compliance with CT was good, with a mean attendance of 22/24 sessions. General subjective gain was achieved by three-fourths of the feedback respondents. However, the fMRI was not feasible in this patient group. Conclusions We successfully randomised 147 persons with mild-to-moderate dementia in the FINCOG trial. The feedback from participants in cognitive intervention was favourable. The trial will provide important information on the effects of CT in patients with dementia.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - To evaluate the difference in the prevention of cognitive impairment and the incidence of dementia in patients with initial stroke between comprehensive rehabilitation training (a combination of cognitive training, rehabilitation training and patient education) plus medical treatment and medical treatment alone. A total of 200 patients from April 2013 to April 2015 with initial onset of ischemic stroke were included. These patients were randomized into the experimental group (comprehensive rehabilitation training plus medical treatment) and control group (medical treatment alone) in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment for 6 months and follow-up for 12 months. The proportion of patients with dementia, the changes from baseline of MMSE (Minimum Mental State Examination) and ADL (activities of daily living score) as well as the proportion of patients with anxiety and patient with depression were evaluated and compared between two groups. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with dementia between experimental group and control group at 3 months and 6 months. However, the proportion of patients with dementia in experimental group was significantly lower than control group at 12 months of follow-up (7.70% vs. 19.20%, P=0.041). The changes from baseline of MMSE (1.67+/-0.34, 95% CI: 1.59-1.75 vs. 5.22+/-0.31, 95% CI: 5.15-5.29, P<0.001) and ADL (2.73+/-0.20, 95% CI: 2.69-2.77 vs. 3.45+/-0.27, 95% CI: 3.39-3.51, P<0.001) in experimental group were significantly decreased when compared to control group at 12th months. In addition, the proportion of patients with anxiety in the experimental group was significantly lower than control group (24.70% vs. 44.60%, P=0.007); whereas no significant difference was observed in the proportion of patients with depression between experimental group and control group (43.20% vs. 45.80%, P=0.74). This study indicates that the comprehensive rehabilitation training reduces the incidence of post-stroke dementia as well as significantly prevents the cognitive function impairment, anxiety and improves activities of daily living in patients of stroke.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

N2  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) alters the functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) but also the topological properties of the functional connectome. Cognitive training (CT) is a tool to slow down AD progression and is likely to impact on functional connectivity. In this pilot study, we aimed at investigating brain functional changes after a period of CT and active control (AC) in a group of 26 subjects with mild AD (mAD), 26 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and a control group of 29 healthy elderly (HE) people. They all underwent a CT and AC in a counterbalanced order following a crossover design. Resting-state functional MRI and neuropsychological testing were acquired before and after each period. We tested post-CT and post- AC changes of cognitive abilities, of the functional connectivity of the DMN, and of topological network properties derived from graph theory and network-based statistics. Only CT produced functional changes, increasing the functional connectivity of the posterior DMN in all three groups. mAD also showed functional changes in the medial temporal lobe and topological changes in the anterior cingulum, whereas aMCI showed more widespread topological changes involving the frontal lobes, the cerebellum and the thalamus. Our results suggest specific functional connectivity changes after CT for aMCI and mAD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Purpose: Medications are the currently accepted symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD), but their impact on delaying the progression of cognitive deficits and functional impairment is limited. The authors aimed to explore long-term electrophysiological effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation interlaced with cognitive training on quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with AD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Quantitative EEG was assessed on non-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation interlaced with cognitive training treatment days before treatment and after each treatment phase in seven patients with mild AD. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After 4.5 months (54 sessions) of treatment, a significant increase of delta activity over the temporal region was found compared with pretreatment values. Nonsignificant increases of the log EEG power were found for alpha band over the frontal and temporal regions, beta band over the frontal region, theta band over the frontal, temporal, and parieto-occipital regions, and delta band over the frontal and parieto-occipital regions. Nonsignificant decreases were found for alpha over the parieto-occipital region, and for beta over the temporal and parieto-occipital regions. A positive correlation was found between log alpha power over the frontal and temporal regions at 6 weeks and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores at 6 weeks and 4.5 months, and between log alpha power over the parieto-occipital regions and MMSE scores at 6 weeks. A negative correlation was found between log alpha power over the frontal and temporal regions at 6 weeks and baseline Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scalecognitive subscale scores. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation interlaced with cognitive training has long-term effects on quantitative EEG in patients with mild AD. Further research on the quantitative EEG long-term effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation interlaced with cognitive training is required to confirm the authors' data.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 by the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society.

N2  - Objective To assess the efficacy of a combination of cognitive training (COG) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), on cognitive performance, locomotor activity, apathy, caregiver burden and dependence of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods A combination of COG and rTMS was performed in 10 patients with AD (NeuroAD procedure) for a period of 5 weeks (one session per day, 5 days a week), without maintenance sessions. Patients were evaluated at the end of the treatment (D45) and 6 months later (M6) by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Alzheimer disease assessment scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), various neuropsychological tests and clinical scores specific for locomotor activity, apathy, caregiver burden, and dependence, recorded before the study (baseline). Results The primary endpoint was the improvement of the ADAS-Cog score at D45, which was reached. Six months after the end of the treatment, the ADAS-Cog score returned to baseline value, except for the best responders who remained significantly improved. The other main result was the improvement of apathy and dependence scores at both D45 and M6 for the entire series of patients. No serious adverse events occurred and all patients completed the study. Conclusions The results of this open-label study confirm the feasibility of the rTMS-COG procedure in AD patients, and suggest that these patients can benefit from the procedure, in terms of cognitive performances, apathy and dependence, even in the long term. These promising results remain to be confirmed in controlled studies based on a larger population size, which could also help identify the prognostic factors associated with good outcome, in order to optimize patient selection.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - Background: FINGER is a multicenter randomized controlled trial (NCT01041989) that demonstrated beneficial effects on cognition for a 2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention (diet, exercise, cognitive training and vascular risk monitoring) compared to control (regular health advice). The present study investigated whether APOE, age, sex, education or baselineMMSE score influenced intervention effects on cognition. <ovid:br/>Method(s): FINGER targeted 1260 people aged 60-77 years from the general Finnish population who were at risk for cognitive impairment based on CAIDE Dementia Risk Score, but without dementia or substantial cognitive impairment. Primary outcome was change in cognition (Neuropsychological Test Battery NTB z-score). Mixed-effects regression models were used to investigatewhether the characteristics of participants (APOE, age, sex, education, baseline MMSE) influenced intervention effects on cognition (intervention x time x characteristic interactions). <ovid:br/>Result(s): FINGER intervention effects on cognition were not significantly different among APOE4 carriers compared to non-carriers (intervention x time x APOE interactions p > 0.2). In stratified analyses the differences between intervention and control groups tended to be significant among carriers (overall cognition p=0.045, executive functioning p = 0.059), but not among non-carriers. No significant differences in intervention effects were found between men and women or across different age or education groups or groups with different MMSE scores at baseline. A trend towards a difference in intervention effects on executive functioning was observed between men and women (intervention x time x sex interaction -0.047, p = 0.067), indicating more pronounced intervention effects on executive functioning among men. Stratified analysis showed that the difference between intervention and control groups in the estimated mean change in executive functioning was significant in men (p = 0.005) but not in women (p = 0.912). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The beneficial effects of the multidomain intervention on cognition in at-risk elderly people were not significantly different by APOE, age, sex, education and baseline cognition. The trend towards more pronounced intervention effects on executive functioning among men compared to women may be explained by the fact that men had more cardiovascular risk factors at baseline, which could be associated with a higher potential for improvement in executive functioning.

N2  - Objectives: Attrition is one of the greatest difficulties in longitudinal studies on cognitive ageing because of the associated risk of underestimating declines. The aims of this paper were to characterize the magnitude and selectivity of attrition in a study of mild cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Forty two patients with multiple-domain amnestic MCI, 71 with single-domain amnestic MCI, 35 with non-amnestic MCI and 318 healthy controls were recruited from primary care centers and assessed at baseline. Measurements: All participants underwent extensive neuropsychological evaluation, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Californian Verbal Learning Test, the CAMCOG-R battery, the Counting Span task and Listening Span task, and the Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 21.5% of the participants at baseline did not participate in the follow-up assessment. Comparison between respondents and non-returners did not reveal differences in cognitive performance in the MCI group. Data obtained at the initial assessment regarding comorbidity, social activities and attention given to memory training enabled prediction of the status of the participants in the follow-up assessment. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Identification of potential non- returners is relevant, especially in MCI studies, in order to develop retention strategies to minimize attrition.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016, Serdi and Springer-Verlag France.

N2  - The nonamnesic type of mild cognitive impairment (na-MCI) is predementia state with subtle decline incognitive domains except memory. Although cognitive rehabilitation (CR) has been investigated in amnesic type of MCI, we could not find any trial that rehabilitated na-MCI exclusively. We studied the effectiveness of CR on na-MCI. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): This study was a blinded, randomized clinical trial. Individuals with age of 60 years or more, complete self-directedness and diagnosis of na-MCI, based on Neuropsychiatry Unit Cognitive assessment tool, were selected. The 51 patients were randomly assigned into three groups: CR, lifestyle (LS) modification, and the control group (CG). Neuropsychological tests for executive functioning were assessed at the baseline, after the interventions, and 6 months later. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The mean score of the "design fluency" test increased significantly in CR, compared to LS and CG (P = 0.007). In "five-point" test, mean score increased significantly in CR (P = 0.03). There was higher mean score of Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function for adults in CR (P = 0.01). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Consideration of the MCI subtypes allows us to target specific cognitive domains, such as information processing, for better CR outcome. CR may result in better performance of executive functioning of daily living.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 Journal of Research in Medical Sciences.

N2  - Aim: To investigate the effect of specific cognitive training with CogniPlus and balance training, affecting cognitive functioning, gait speed, risk and fear of falling, and quality of life in an elderly cohort with mild cognitive impairment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The research sample was composed of 80 older adults with a mild cognitive deficit (mean age 67.07 years) divided into the experimental group (n = 40) and control group (n = 40). This was a randomized, controlled trial. The experimental group carried out selected exercises from the CogniPlus program combined with balance training. Patients participated in 20 sessions twice per week in an outpatient clinic. Both groups completed 30 min of balance training daily for 10 weeks. Cognitive functions were evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination. The fear of falling was assessed by Falls Efficacy Scale-I. The static and dynamic aspects of balance were assessed by the Tinetti test and functional stretching. Gait speed was assessed by four forms of the Timed Up & Go test. Quality of life was investigated according to Spitzer. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The two groups showed significant differences recorded after training in the Mini-Mental State Examination, Up and Go test with dual tasking, balance by Tinetti test and the quality of life in favor of the experimental group (P < 0.03-0.0001). There were no significant differences found between the groups in the assessment of fear of falling and other monitored parameters. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The combination of selected exercises from the CogniPlus program with balance training contributed to achieving better results than balance training alone for elderly people with mild cognitive impairment.

N2  - Background: The use of Serious exerGames (SeG) as enriched environments (EE), which promotes cognitive simulation with physical activity in a positive emotional context, has been proposed to represent a powerful method to slow down the decline due to neurodegenerative diseases (ND), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, so far, no SeG targeting EE has been tested in ND subjects. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study aimed at evaluating the usability and short-term training effects of X-Torp, an action SeG designed for elderly ND subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): X-Torp is a SeG played using the Microsoft<ovid:sup></ovid:sup> KinectTM. 10 ND subjects and 8 healthy elderly controls (HEC) were enrolled in a 1-month program with three training sessions per week. Usability was evaluated through game time, game performance, the aerobic intensity level reached, perceived emotions, and perceived usability. <ovid:br/>Result(s): All participants successfully completed the training program. ND subjects played less and had a lower game performance compared to HEC. During the sessions, ND subjects maintained a light intensity of aerobic activity, while HEC maintained a moderate intensity. Both groups experienced only positive emotions, and reported a 'moderate' to 'high' perceived competence, a 'moderate' game difficulty, and a 'high' interest in the game. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Usability results suggest that X-Torp represents a usable EE for healthy subjects and persons with MCI and AD. However, in order to reach moderate or high intensity of aerobic activity, X-Torp control modes should be adapted to become more physically stimulating.

N2  - Background Cognitive dysfunction treatment remains an unmet clinical need in major depressive disorder (MDD). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may improve cognitive symptoms in MDD. Our aim was to investigate the cognitive effects of tDCS in the Sertraline vs. Electric Current Therapy for Treating Depression Clinical Study (SELECT-TDCS). We also explored whether tDCS could have mood-independent cognitive effects. Methods One hundred twenty MDD patients aged from 18 to 65 years received 12 sessions of active/sham tDCS (2 mA for 30 min) and real/placebo 50 mg/d sertraline over 6 weeks in a factorial trial. We analyzed whether changes in performance of neuropsychological tests (Trail Making, Digit Span, Stroop Task, Mini-Mental Status Exam and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) occurred over time, according to treatment group and depression improvement. Exploratory analyses were carried out to verify the influence of clinical and demographic variables on the outcomes. Results Cognitive improvement was showed in most tests used, although they occurred regardless of intervention type and depression improvement. Further exploratory analyses revealed that clinical response and education level could have mediated pro-cognitive tDCS effects on some of the tests used. Limitations The neuropsychological battery used might not have been sensitive to detect tDCS-induced effects on cognition. Lack of simultaneous cognitive training during application may have also limited its cognitive effects. Conclusions We found no evidence of beneficial or deleterious cognitive effects of tDCS as a treatment for depression. We discussed clinical trial design considerations for further tDCS studies assessing cognitive effects, including sample and outcomes considerations.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: This project proposes a pilot study to investigate the positive healing effects of cognitive training with simple arithmetic and reading aloud on elderly postsurgical patients. Elderly patients undergoing surgery have an increased risk of Postoperative Cognitive Decline (POCD), a condition in which learning, memory, and processing speed is greatly reduced after surgery. Since elderly patients are more likely to exhibit symptoms of POCD, the incidence is increasing as the population receiving surgery has aged. Little effort has been expended, however, to find treatments for POCD. Learning therapy, which consists of a combination of reading aloud and solving simple arithmetic problems, was developed in Japan as a treatment for Alzheimer's Disease to improve cognitive functions. Because patients with Alzheimer's Disease experience similar issues as those with POCD in learning, memory, and processing speed, a cognitive intervention based on the learning-therapy treatments used for Alzheimer's Disease could show advantageous outcomes for those at risk of POCD. Methods/design: Cognitive function will be measured before and after surgery using three different tests (Mini-Mental Status Exam, Frontal Assessment Battery, and Cogstate computerized tests). Subjects will be randomly divided into two groups-one that receives a Simple Calculation and Reading Aloud intervention (SCRA) and a waitlisted control group that does not receive SCRA. To measure cognition before and after the intervention, the previously mentioned three tests will be used. The obtained data will be analyzed using statistical tests such as ANCOVA to indicate whether the cognitive intervention group has made improvements in their cognitive functions. In addition, questionnaires will also be administered to collect data on mental and emotional statuses. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): This report will be the first pilot study to investigate the beneficial effects of SCRA on elderly surgical patients. Previous studies have shown sufficient evidence on the effectiveness of learning therapy in healthy elderly people and in those with Dementia. Therefore, this study will clarify whether SCRA can improve cognitive function in the more specialized group of elderly surgical patients.

N2  - Background: Although non-drug interventions are widely used in patients with Alzheimer's disease, few large scale randomized trials involving a long-term intervention and several cognitive-oriented approaches have been carried out. ETNA3 trial compares the effect of cognitive training, reminiscence therapy, and an individualized cognitive rehabilitation program in Alzheimer's disease to usual care. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This is a multicenter (40 French clinical sites) randomized, parallel-group trial, with a two-year follow-up comparing groups receiving standardized programs of cognitive training (group sessions), reminiscence therapy (group sessions), individualized cognitive rehabilitation program (individual sessions), and usual care (reference group). Six hundred fifty-three outpatients with Alzheimer's disease were recruited. The primary efficacy outcome was the rate of survival without moderately severe to severe dementia at two years. Secondary outcomes were cognitive impairment, functional disability, behavioral disturbance, apathy, quality of life, depression, caregiver's burden, and resource utilization. <ovid:br/>Result(s): No impact on the primary efficacy measure was evidenced. For the two group interventions (i.e. cognitive training and reminiscence), none of the secondary outcomes differed from usual care. The larger effect was seen with individualized cognitive rehabilitation in which significantly lower functional disability and a six-month delay in institutionalization at two years were evidenced. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These findings challenge current management practices of Alzheimer's patients. While cognitive-oriented group therapies have gained popularity, this trial does not show improvement for the patients. The individualized cognitive rehabilitation intervention provided clinically significant results. Individual interventions should be considered to delay institutionalization in Alzheimer's disease.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; International Psychogeriatric Association 2015.

N2  - Background: The evidence base in cognitive rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis (MS) is still sparse. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on cognitive and executive coping, psychological well-being and psychological aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with MS. <ovid:br/>Method(s): One hundred and twenty patients with cognitive complaints, taking part in a 4-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation, were randomized to an intervention group (n = 60) and a control group (n = 60). Both groups underwent neuropsychological assessment with subsequent feedback and took part in general multidisciplinary MS rehabilitation. Additionally, the intervention group participated in cognitive group sessions as well as individual sessions. The main focus was to formulate Goal Attainment Scaling goals for coping with cognitive challenges. For 3 months past rehabilitation, the intervention group received biweekly telephone follow-up, focusing on goal attainment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Executive functioning improved significantly from baseline to four and 7 months in both groups. Improvements in psychological well-being and psychological aspects of HRQoL occurred only in the intervention group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Multicomponent cognitive rehabilitation administered within the context of multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve psychological well-being and psychological aspects of HRQoL.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - Objective The aim of this paper was to assess the efficacy of process-based cognitive training (pb-CT) combined with reminiscence therapy (RT) in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (mAD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in healthy elderly (HE) subjects. Methods This multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involved 348 participants with mAD, MCI, and HE from four European countries. Participants were randomly assigned to two arms of a crossover design: those in arm A underwent 3 months of computerized pb-CT for memory and executive functions combined with RT and 3 months of rest; those in arm B underwent the reverse. The primary outcome was the effect of the training on memory and executive functions performance. The secondary outcome was the effect of the training on functional abilities in mAD assessed with the instrumental activities of daily living. Results We found a significant effect of the training for memory in all three groups on delayed recall of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test and for executive functions in HE on the phonological fluency test. MCI and HE participants maintained these effects at follow-up. MCI and mAD participants also showed a significant effect of the training on the Mini-mental state examination scale. Participants with mAD showed more stable instrumental activities of daily living during the training versus the rest period. Conclusions Our results corroborate the positive effect of pb-CT and its maintenance primarily on memory in HE and MCI participants that did not seem to be potentiated by RT. Moreover, our results are very promising for the mAD participants.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: Assessing the efficacy of a novel computer- based cognitive training program in patients with mild Alzheimer disease (mAD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in healthy elderly (HE) subjects. Materials: The training was administered using a software that resulted from a project co-funded by the European Union (CIP-ICT-PSP) (http://www. cognitivetraining.eu) called Sociable and operating on a touch-screen computer. The software included exercises for the process based cognitive training (pb-CT) for the different cognitive abilities and an electronic book called Book of Life for the reminescence therapy (RT). <ovid:br/>Method(s): A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involved 348 participants with mAD, MCI and HE from four European countries. Participants were randomized in two arms of a crossover design: arm A consisted in 3 months of computerized cognitive training focused on memory and executive functions combined with RT and 3 months of rest; those in arm B underwent the reverse. All participants were followed up for 6 months, with assessments at baseline, at 3 months and at 6 months. The training consisted in 24 one-hour treatment sessions (individual or group) twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the effect of the training on cognitive functions, with specific focus on memory and executive functions performance in the experimental group, compared with the control group. The secondary outcome was the effect of the training on functional abilities assessed with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). <ovid:br/>Result(s): We found a significant effect of the training for memory in all three groups on delayed recall of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test and for executive functions in HE on the phonological fluency test. MCI and HE participants maintained these effects at follow-up. MCI and mAD participants also showed a significant effect of the training on the Mini Mental State Examination scale. Participants with mAD showed more stable instrumental activities of daily living during the training versus the rest period. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): The study showed the efficacy of the computerized cognitive training program combined with reminiscence therapy in mAD and MCI and healthy elderly participants. Effect sizes on memory measures, consistently with previous evidence, were in the medium range. Further studies are needed to assess the specificity of this combined training. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results corroborate the positive effect of pb-CT and its maintenance primarily on memory in HE and MCI participants that did not seem to be potentiated by RT. Moreover, our results are very promising for the mAD participants.

N2  - Objectives: A multitude of variables associated with a number of outcome variables present a risk factor for ambiguous findings in clinical trials and studies on traumatic brain injury (TBI) (Levin et al. 2013). Impairments in memory are a major consequence after TBI (Sandry et al. 2015). Functional brain mapping along with neuropsychological assessments can provide objective evidence of deficits in people after injury. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Thirty-four consenting patients from an ongoing Randomized Clinical Trial (CTRI/2014/04/004555) aged between 18-45 years, within 1 month post-mild or moderate TBI were randomly assigned to the control group (CG) (Mean age = 30.8 +/- 9.2 years) (Baseline n = 17; Follow-up n = 13) or intervention group (IG) (Mean age = 32.3 +/- 10.2 years) (Baseline n = 17; follow-up n = 10). Patients were evaluated on neuropsychological measures and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) for Memory. Episodic memory, recent memory, working memory, focused attention, delayed recall, short-term verbal memory, paired associate learning, new learning, visual memory, recognition ability and mental status were tested using standardized Indian neuropsychological tools, namely: PGI-Memory Scale (PGIMS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Neuropsychological Evaluation Screening Tool (NEST). fMRI paradigm for short-term visual memory was given to eight consenting patients (CG: n = 3, IG: n = 5) using 1.5 MRI Tesla scanner using Superlab and binocular camera with eye-tracker (Nordic Neurolab, Norway). Feedback was taken using a 4-button response pad (Cedrus Inc., USA). The 6-week indigenized literacy free cognitive rehabilitation intervention included retraining in areas of visual short-term, long-term memory; focused and divided attention; planning and visuo-spatial ability and relaxation techniques. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Pre-post analysis using Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed improvements in memory in both the groups; but a more significant improvement in the IG was observed in episodic memory (p = 0.030); working memory (p = 0.016); short-term verbal memory (p = 0.007); paired associate learning (p = 0.050); new learning (p = 0.007); and mental status (p = 0.005). Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) revealed activations in culmen and precentral gyrus during visual recall of known objects and for unknown landscapes activations were observed in cuneus, parahippocampal gyrus, declive, cerebellar tonsil, fusiform gyrus, precuneus and lingual gyrus. Post-6 weeks of intervention, right middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 6) was significantly active in comparison to the pre-therapy fMRI session. The intervention group exhibited activation in left cerebral lingual gyrus in comparison to the control group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These findings demonstrate retrieval of visual memory processing post-cognitive rehabilitation, as demonstrated by activation in lingual gyrus during processing of visual cues and middle frontal gyrus activated during pressing of response buttons. Specific activations pre- and post-cognitive interventions can provide valuable information for cognitive recovery after brain injury and may contribute to guide clinicians for specific biomarkers for rehabilitation.

N2  - Goal: We carried out a pilot study to investigate the feasibility and possible efficacy of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) for Alzheimer's type dementia in Italian patients. <ovid:br/>Patient(s): Seven patients aged (mean+/-SD) 80+/-4 years, affected by Alzheimer's type dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We patterned our intervention after published protocols of CST (Spector et al., 2006). To this aim we created suitable materials in Italian. We delivered 15 group sessions twice a week. To each patient we administered the following tests before and after CST: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GST), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). <ovid:br/>Result(s): We found no change after CST in MMSE. Similarly, we found no change in GDS, however 4 out of 5 patients that had a GDS>5 at baseline (suggestive of clinically relevant depression) showed improvement after CST. Both ADAS-Cog and NPI improved after CST. Discussion and <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results are in agreement with clinical trials (e.g., Niu et al., 2010) and with one Cochrane meta-analysis of CST (Woods et al., 2012). They showed significant improvement in non-cognitive symptoms of dementia (BPSD cluster) and in caregiver burden of care, while some improvement was shown in cognitive symptoms as well. They support the need for a fullypowered, controlled study on the efficacy of CST in Italian patients.

N2  - Background: Chronic insomnia is a prevalent disorder associated with significant psychosocial, health, and economic impacts. Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) and benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BzRA) medications are the most widely supported therapeutic approaches for insomnia management. However, few investigations have directly compared their relative and combined benefits, and even fewer have tested the benefits of sequential treatment for those who do not respond to initial insomnia therapy. Moreover, insomnia treatment studies have been limited by small, highly screened study samples, fixed-dose, and fixed-agent pharmacotherapy strategies that do not represent usual clinical practices. This study will address these limitations. Methods/design: This is a two-site randomized controlled trial, which will enroll 224 adults who meet the criteria for a chronic insomnia disorder with or without comorbid psychiatric disorders. Prospective participants will complete clinical assessments and polysomnography and then will be randomly assigned to first-stage therapy involving either behavioral therapy (BT) or zolpidem. Treatment outcomes will be assessed after 6 weeks, and treatment remitters will be followed for the next 12 months on maintenance therapy. Those not achieving remission will be offered randomization to a second, 6-week treatment, again involving either pharmacotherapy (zolpidem or trazodone) or psychological therapy (BT or cognitive therapy (CT)). All participants will be re-evaluated 12 weeks after the protocol initiation and at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. Insomnia remission, defined categorically as a score < 8 on the Insomnia Severity Index, a patient-reported outcome, will serve as the primary endpoint for treatment comparisons. Secondary outcomes will include sleep parameters derived from daily sleep diaries and from polysomnography, subjective measures of fatigue, mood, quality of life, and functional impairments; and measures of adverse events; dropout rates; and treatment acceptability. Centrally trained therapists will administer therapies according to manualized, albeit flexible, treatment algorithms. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): This clinical trial will provide new information about optimal treatment sequencing and will have direct implication for the development of clinical guidelines for managing chronic insomnia with and without comorbid psychiatric conditions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 Morin et al.

N2  - Background. There is a growing number of studies indicating the major consequences of the subjective perception of well-being on mental health and healthcare use. However, most of the cognitive training research focuses more on the preservation of cognitive function than on the implications of the state of well-being. This secondary analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial investigated the effects of individualised television-based cognitive training on self-rated well-being using the WHO-5 index while considering gender and education as influencing factors. The effects of cognitive training were compared with leisure activities that the elderly could be engaged in to pass time. Methods. Cognitively healthy participants aged 60 years or above screened using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Major Depression Inventory (MDI) were randomly allocated to a cognitive training group or to an active control group in a single-blind controlled two-group design and underwent 24 training sessions. Data acquired from the WHO-5 questionnaire administered before and after intervention were statistically analysed using a mixed design model for repeated measures. The effect of individualised cognitive training was compared with leisure activities while the impact of gender and education was explored using estimated marginal means. Results. A total of 81 participants aged 67.9 +/- 5.59 [60-84] without cognitive impairments and absent of depression symptoms underwent the study. Participants with leisure time activities declared significantly higher scores compared to participants with cognitive training M =73.48+/-2.88, 95% CI [67.74-79.22] vs M = 64.13 +/- 3.034, 95%CI [58.09-70.17]WHO-5score. Gender and education were found to moderate the effect of cognitive training on well-being when compared to leisure activities. Females engaged in leisure activities in the control group reported higher by M =9.77 +/- 5.4, 95% CI [-0.99-20.54] WHO-5scores than females with the cognitive training regimen. Participants with high school education declared leisure activities to increase WHO-5 scores byM =14.59 +/- 5.39, 95% CI [3.85-25.34] compared to individualised cognitive training. Discussion. The findings revealed that individualised cognitive training was not directly associated with improvements in well-being. Changes in the control group indicated that involvement in leisure time activities, in which participants were partly free to choose from, represented more favourable stimulation to a self-perceived sense of well-being than individualised cognitive training. Results also supported the fact that gender and education moderated the effect of cognitive training on well-being. Females and participants with high school education were found to be negatively impacted in well-being when performance connected with cognitive training was expected.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 Bures et al.

N2  - Alcohol abuse can impact on general cognitive functioning and more particularly on frontal lobe functions. One option available to reduce this impact may rest on rehabilitation paradigms that include cognitive stimulation programmes. This paper reports on a randomized controlled study where two samples of patients with alcohol dependence syndrome where enrolled: (i) on a mHealth-based cognitive stimulation program (CSP) within alcohol dependence treatment (experimental group); and (ii) on the alcohol dependence treatment without CSP (control group). The CSP mHealth applications consisted of a series of serious games designed to stimulate frontal lobe functions. Assessment was conducted with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Frontal Assessment Battery. After 10 stimulation sessions the experimental group evidenced a significant improvement on frontal-lobe functioning when compared with the control group. As expected, no differences on general cognitive functioning were found between groups.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

N2  - Aims: This study aimed to investigate the effect of 6-month physical exercise with a multicomponent cognitive program (MCP) on the cognitive function of older adults with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). <ovid:br/>Method(s): We included 33 participants with AD in a 6-month randomized controlled trial. The intervention group participated in physical exercise and received a MCP. The control group received only the MCP. Before and after the intervention, cognitive outcomes were assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Clock Drawing Test. Physical performance was evaluated by exercise time, the number of pedal rotation, total load, grip strength, and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). <ovid:br/>Result(s): In all cognitive measures, there were no significant improvements between the two groups after 6 months in the baseline value-adjusted primary analysis. However, the ADAS-cog score was significantly lower between the two groups in secondary analysis adjusted for baseline value, age, sex, and education years. All physical outcomes were significantly higher in the intervention group except for total load compared with baseline measurements. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study indicates that it is possible to improve cognitive function in older adults with moderate to severe AD through 6-month physical exercise with a multicomponent cognitive intervention.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

N2  - Purpose of the study: Everyday memory of older persons does not improve with intensive memory training programs. This study proposes a change in these programs based on a time-extended and massive intervention format. Design and Methods: The sample of 1007 healthy older persons (mean age 71.85; SD = 5.12) was randomized into 2 groups. The experimental group followed an extended 6 years of training (192 sessions over 192 weeks) whereas the control group received an intensive training (3 sessions per week for a total of 32 sessions in 11 weeks). The program included cognitive and emotional content whose effects were assessed with the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT) and with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Both groups were evaluated initially, after 32 sessions, and again after 6 years. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The relative improvements measured with Blom's derivative showed that everyday memory and mental status of the experimental group were significantly better both in the short (DELTA% 8.31 in RBMT and DELTA% 1.51 in MMSE) and in the long term (DELTA% 12.54 in RBMT and DELTA% 2.56 in MMSE). For everyday memory and mental level, the overall gain estimate representing the mean difference in pre-post change between time-extended and intensive groups was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.13-0.40) and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.40-0.67), respectively. Time-extended programs have significantly improved everyday memory in contrast with the usual intensive programs whose effects decay with time. There are also significant increases in mental level scores while daily life functionality is preserved in all subjects who completed the training. Implications: These results suggest that it is possible to preserve everyday memory in the long term with continuous training and practice. Massive and time-extended formats may contribute in the future to a paradigm shift in memory programs for healthy older people.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 Requena, Turrero and Ortiz.

N2  - Background Modifiable vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors have been associated with dementia risk in observational studies. In the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), a proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial, we aimed to assess a multidomain approach to prevent cognitive decline in at-risk elderly people from the general population. Methods In a double-blind randomised controlled trial we enrolled individuals aged 60-77 years recruited from previous national surveys. Inclusion criteria were CAIDE (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia) Dementia Risk Score of at least 6 points and cognition at mean level or slightly lower than expected for age. We randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to a 2 year multidomain intervention (diet, exercise, cognitive training, vascular risk monitoring), or a control group (general health advice). Computer-generated allocation was done in blocks of four (two individuals randomly allocated to each group) at each site. Group allocation was not actively disclosed to participants and outcome assessors were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was change in cognition as measured through comprehensive neuropsychological test battery (NTB) Z score. Analysis was by modified intention to treat (all participants with at least one post-baseline observation). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01041989. Findings Between Sept 7, 2009, and Nov 24, 2011, we screened 2654 individuals and randomly assigned 1260 to the intervention group (n=631) or control group (n=629). 591 (94%) participants in the intervention group and 599 (95%) in the control group had at least one post-baseline assessment and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. Estimated mean change in NTB total Z score at 2 years was 0.20 (SE 0.02, SD 0.51) in the intervention group and 0.16 (0.01, 0.51) in the control group. Between-group difference in the change of NTB total score per year was 0.022 (95% CI 0.002-0.042, p=0.030). 153 (12%) individuals dropped out overall. Adverse events occurred in 46 (7%) participants in the intervention group compared with six (1%) participants in the control group; the most common adverse event was musculoskeletal pain (32 [5%] individuals for intervention vs no individuals for control). Interpretation Findings from this large, long-term, randomised controlled trial suggest that a multidomain intervention could improve or maintain cognitive functioning in at-risk elderly people from the general population.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the effects of elastic band resistance training in combination with nutrient supplementation on muscular strength and the ability to perform mobility-related activities of daily living in older adults living in retirement care facilities. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Randomized controlled trial, with a 6-month intervention period. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): A retirement care facility, Vienna, Austria. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): One hundred and seventeen older adults (14 males (12%) and 103 females (88%)), aged 65 to 97. years (mean age: 82.8 +/- 6.0), having a mini-mental state examination score >=. 23 and no chronic diseases posing a medical contraindication to training therapy. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): Participants were randomly assigned, but stratified by sex, to one of three intervention groups: supervised resistance exercise training (RT), RT in combination with nutrient supplementation (RTS), or cognitive training group (CT). All interventions were performed two times a week for 6. months. RT was designed to train all major muscle groups using elastic bands. The nutrient supplement (rich in proteins, vitamin D, B2, B12) was distributed every morning as well as after each RT session. Measurements: A battery of motor ability tests and functional test were performed prior to as well as following 3. months and finally after 6. months of intervention. These tests included isokinetic torque measurements of the knee extensors and flexors in concentric mode at 60 and 120degree/s, isometric handgrip strength, senior arm-lifting test, chair stand test, maximum walking speed and a 6-minute walking test (6MWT). <ovid:br/>Result(s): A repeated-measures ANOVA analysis revealed significant improvements in physical function of lower (p= 0.002) and upper extremities (p = 0.006) for RT and/or RTS in comparison to CT. For isokinetic measurements, 6MWT, and gait speed time effects (p <0.05) were detected without any group. x. time interaction effects. Dropouts showed lower performance in chair stand test (p= 0.012), 6MWT (p= 0.003), and gait speed (p= 0.013) at baseline than that of the finishers of the study. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Six months of a low intensity resistance exercise using elastic bands and own body weight is safe and beneficial in improving functional performance of institutionalised older people. Multinutrient supplementation did not offer additional benefits to the effects of RT in improving muscular performance.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 Elsevier Inc..

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a multimedia and interactive cognitive program on cognition and depressive symptomatology in healthy older adults. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Adults aged >=65 years were randomly assigned to two groups: the experimental group in which the participants received a computerized cognitive training application; and the control group in which the participants received no intervention during the protocol. Performance on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the short-form of the geriatric depression scale (GDS-SF) were analysed using a three-way repeated-measure analysis of variance. <ovid:br/>Result(s): To determine cognition after the training, the cognitive program was used and the results were assessed using the MMSE, indicating that the significant time effects within the groups reflected the score for cognitive assessment that was significantly better after the intervention in the experimental group. No significant differences were observed with regard to the depressive symptomatology or between the groups according to sex or educational level on the two dimensions previously established (cognition and depressive symptomatology). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The development of technological applications for intervention in older adults is increasing. Based on the established objective, we can conclude that the computerized intervention may constitute a good alternative to enhance the cognitive status in older people.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: The Canary Islands longitudinal study on non-pharmacological treatments showed the overall effectiveness of mindfulness in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, no specific data on the maintenance of cognitive capacities were presented. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To determine whether the practice of mindfulness modifies the course of cognitive impairment in AD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Design: Longitudinal, non-inferiority and equivalence, randomized clinical trial, repeated-measures design, with three experimental groups and one control group. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Patients with AD who voluntarily attended the Lidia Garcia Foundation (n = 502). Only those who were treated with donepezil and MMSE >=18 were included (n = 120). <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): Over a two-year period, each group carried out three weekly sessions of stimulation based on mindfulness, cognitive stimulation therapy, and progressive muscle relaxation. Measures: Cognitive assessment CAMDEX-R (MMSE and CAMCOG). Statistical analysis: Repeated-measures ANOVA (p < 0.05) and the effect size Cohen's d were performed. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The mindfulness group showed significant scores compared with the control and muscle relaxation groups (p < 0.05), while mindfulness and cognitive stimulation therapy were equivalent (p>=0.05). Group cognitive stimulation evolved better than the control (p < 0.05) group but not better than the muscle relaxation group (p>=0.05). The effect size compared over two years was large for the mindfulness group (p>=0.80), moderate for the relaxation group (p>=0.50), and low for the cognitive stimulation group (p>=0.20). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The practice of mindfulness maintained cognitive function over a period of two years. This longitudinal study suggests that mindfulness can be used as a non-pharmacological treatment to slow cognitive impairment in AD.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the beneficial effects on cognitive function by a cognitive intervention program designed for dementia care called Learning Therapy in Japan and SAIDO Learning in the United States (hereinafter "SAIDO Learning," as appropriate). SAIDO Learning is a working memory training program that uses systematized basic problems in arithmetic and language, including reading aloud, as well as writing. Design, Setting, Participants, and Intervention: Twenty-three nursing home residents with dementia were assigned as an intervention group, and another 24 people with dementia at another nursing home were assigned as a control group. Both nursing homes were operated by the same organization, and residents of both nursing homes received essentially the same nursing care. Thirteen and 6 subjects of the intervention and control groups, respectively, were clinically diagnosed as Alzheimer disease (AD). <ovid:br/>Result(s): After the 6-month intervention, the participants with AD of the intervention group showed statistically significant improvement in cognitive function, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) compared with the control participants. In addition, post hoc analysis revealed that the Frontal Assessment Battery at Bedside (FAB) scores of the intervention group tended to improve after 6-month intervention. Based on MDS scores, improvements in total mood severity scores also were observed, but only in the intervention group of the participants with AD. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These results suggest that SAIDO Learning is an effective cognitive intervention and is useful for dementia care. An additional outcome of this intervention, which has not yet been evaluated in detail, appears to be that it promotes greater positive engagement of a diversity of nursing home staff in the residents' individual progress and care needs.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

N2  - Background: Cognitive training may contribute to the ability to maintain cognitive function in healthy elderly adults. Whether genotype modifies training effects remains unknown. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): Assess influence of APOE on cognitive function over time in community-dwelling elderly adults participating in multi-domain cognitive training. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Healthy individuals ?70 years of age were screened from one urban community in Shanghai. 145 healthy Chinese older adults met inclusion criteria and were assigned to intervention (n = 88) or control (n = 57) groups. Multi-domain cognitive training involved 24 sessions of different content taking place over 12 weeks. Neuropsychological testing was administered at baseline, immediately after training, six months and twelve months post-intervention; composite measures of cognitive function were identified via factor analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Three factors explained the majority of variance in function (verbal memory, processing speed, executive function). The intervention attenuated 12-month declines in processing speed, regardless of APOE genotype (p = 0.047). Executive function declined in APOE epsilon4 carriers over 12 months, regardless of intervention (p = 0.056). There was a significant interaction after 12 months where intervention epsilon4 carriers had better processing speed than epsilon4 controls (p = 0.003). Intervention epsilon2 carriers had better executive function immediately after training (p = 0.02) and had better verbal memory 6-months post-intervention (p = 0.04). These effects remained significant after false-discovery rate correction. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Multi-domain cognitive training reduces declines in processing speed over time. APOE epsilon4 is associated with reductions in executive function over time, and training may attenuate epsilon4-associated declines in processing speed. APOE epsilon2 carriers may also benefit from training, particularly on measures of executive function and verbal memory.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Executive functions play an important role in the maintenance of autonomy in day-to-day activities. Nevertheless, there is little research into specific cognitive training for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). We present the results of a program which aims to teach specific strategies and metacognitive abilities in order for patients to be able to carry out attentional and executive tasks. Two groups (A and B) were compared in a cross-over design. After the first evaluation, Group A (but not B) participated in a six month cognitive stimulation program. After a second assessment, only Group B received treatment and then a final evaluation was carried out on both groups. The results show that: i) both groups improved their performance as an effect of training; ii) improvements generalized to memory and general cognitive tasks; iii) in the interval without training, Group B's performance worsened and iv) Group A partially maintained their results over time.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2014.

N2  - Background: Nonpharmacological interventions such as exercise and cognitive rehabilitation programs have shown promise in reducing the impact of dementia on the individual and the caregiver. In this study, we examine the effect of a multimodal cognitive and physical rehabilitation program for persons with mild dementia and their caregivers using conventional measures of cognition, behavior, quality of life (QoL), and caregiver burden together with goal attainment scaling (GAS), an individualized outcome measure. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Goals were set at baseline, and GAS score was calculated at the end of the program. Participants were also assessed with the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination, functional and behavioral scales (Barthel Index), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, QoL, and caregiver burden using EuroQol-five dimension questionnaire and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Differences in median scores postintervention were obtained. Further analysis of caregiver burden was undertaken utilizing the multidimensional classification of burden on the ZBI. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Thirty-four (61.8%) patients were assessed to have met their goals (GAS score >=50). Mean (standard deviation) GAS score was 48.6 (6.5). Cognition goals were set in only 20.6%, followed by goals to improve engagement and socialization; reduce caregiver stress; and improve physical function, behavior, and mood. Median scores in the cognitive, functional, and QoL measures did not differ significantly pre- and postintervention. The intervention had a positive impact on role strain, a unique dimension of caregiver burden. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study provides evidence that a multimodal approach combining physical exercise and cognitive rehabilitation improves goal attainment and caregiver burden in individuals and caregivers of persons with mild dementia.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 Chew et al.

N2  - Objective To evaluate in a pilot single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial the efficacy of an integrated treatment with rivastigmine transdermal patch (RTP) and cognitive stimulation (CS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients at 6-month follow-up. Methods We enrolled 90 patients with an age >=65years admitted to the outpatient Alzheimer's Evaluation Unit with diagnosis of AD. Patients were randomized to enter in the Group-1 (RTP+CS) or in the Group-2 (RTP). All patients at baseline and after 6months were evaluated with the following tools: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Distress (NPI-D), and a standardized Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, including also activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Mortality risk was assessed using the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI). Results At baseline no significant difference was shown between the two groups. After 6months of follow-up, there were significant differences between Group-1 and Group-2 in: MMSE: +6.39% vs. +2.69%, CDR: +6.92% vs. +1.54%, HDRS-D=-60.7% vs. -45.8%, GDS: -60.9% vs. -7.3%, NPI: -55.2% vs. -32.7%%, NPI-D: -55.1% vs. -18.6%, ADL: +13.88% vs. +5.95%, IADL: +67.59% vs. +18.28%, MNA: +12.02% vs. +5.91%, and MPI: -29.03% vs. -12.90%. Conclusion The integrated treatment of RTP with CS in AD patients for 6months improved significantly cognition, depressive and neuropsychiatric symptoms, functional status, and mortality risk in comparison with a group of AD patients receiving only RTP.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Objective The objective of this study is to compare three different interventions for persons who report memory difficulties: health promotion, cognitive training, and a participation-centered course, using a single-blind, randomized controlled design. Methods Participants were 44 Israeli adults with memory complaints, aged 65years or older. The main outcome variable was the Global Cognitive Score assessed using the MindStreams<ovid:sup></ovid:sup> mild cognitive impairment assessment, a computerized cognitive assessment. The Mini-Mental State Examination and the self-report of memory difficulties were also utilized. To assess well-being, the UCLA Loneliness Scale-8 was used. Health was evaluated by self-report instruments. Results All three interventions resulted in significant improvement in cognitive function as measured by the computerized cognitive assessment. All approaches seemed to decrease loneliness. The only variable which showed a significant difference among the groups is the self-report of memory difficulties, in which the cognitive training group participants reported greater improvement than the other groups. Conclusion Multiple approaches should be offered to older persons with memory complaints. The availability of diverse options would help fit the needs of a heterogeneous population. An educational media effort to promote the public's understanding of the efficacy of these multiple approaches is needed.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - The present study investigates whether a combined cognitive and physical training may induce changes in the cortical activity as measured via electroencephalogram (EEG) and whether this change may index a deceleration of pathological processes of brain aging. Seventy seniors meeting the clinical criteria of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were equally divided into 5 groups: 3 experimental groups engaged in eight-week cognitive and/or physical training and 2 control groups: active and passive. A 5-minute long resting state EEG was measured before and after the intervention. Cortical EEG sources were modelled by exact low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). Cognitive function was assessed before and after intervention using a battery of neuropsychological tests including the minimental state examination (MMSE). A significant training effect was identified only after the combined training scheme: a decrease in the post- compared to pre-training activity of precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex in delta, theta, and beta bands. This effect was correlated to improvements in cognitive capacity as evaluated by MMSE scores. Our results indicate that combined physical and cognitive training shows indices of a positive neuroplastic effect in MCI patients and that EEG may serve as a potential index of gains versus cognitive declines and neurodegeneration. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02313935.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 Charis Styliadis et al.

N2  - Objective We evaluated the short-term efficacy of a protocol of cognitive stimulation (CS), compared with a sham intervention, on cognitive performance in cognitively healthy individuals with a family history of dementia (NDFAM) and in non-demented individuals with cognitive impairment (CI). Methods We performed a randomized controlled trial of CS in NDFAM and CI. CS consisted in 10 twice weekly meetings of CS focused on a specific cognitive area. CS was compared with a sham intervention (CT) using Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Corsi test. All study participants were typed for the presence of apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon4. Results Cognitively healthy NDFAM showed a higher net cognitive gain after CS, as reflected in their MoCA score, and a borderline significant net increase in visuospatial memory (Corsi test) compared with those receiving the CT. APOE-epsilon4 carriers showed a less significant improvement on the Corsi test with respect to APOE-epsilon4 non-carriers. In the CI sample, the MoCA and Corsi test results did not differ between the cognitively stimulated subjects and the controls. No changes in MMSE scores were found in either sample of subjects. Conclusions These findings suggest that CS as structured in this study is an effective treatment in cognitively healthy individuals, whereas it is less effective in individuals with CI. Moreover, evaluation of APOE-epsilon4 status provided evidence of a substantial genetic contribution to the efficacy of CS on visuospatial memory as measured using the Corsi test.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - We previously demonstrated the beneficial effects of a multisensory and cognitive stimulation program, consisting of 48 sessions, twice a week, to improve the cognition of elderly subjects living either in long-term care institutions (institutionalized - I) or in communities with their families (noninstitutionalized - NI). In the present study, we evaluated these subjects after the end of the intervention and compared the rate of age-related cognitive decline of those living in an enriched community environment (NI group, n=15, 74.1+/-3.9 years old) with those living in the impoverished environment of long-term care institutions (I group, n=20, 75.1+/-6.8 years old). Both groups participated fully in our stimulation program. Over 1 year, we conducted revaluations at five time points (2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 8 months, and 12 months) after the completion of the intervention. Both elderly groups were evaluated with the mini-mental state examination and selected language tests. Progressive cognitive decline was observed in both groups over the period. Indeed, it took only 4-6 months after the end of the stimulation program for significant reductions in language test scores to become apparent. However, earlier reductions in test scores were mainly associated with I group, and linguistic prosody test scores were significantly affected by institutionalization and time, two variables that interacted and reduced these scores. Moreover, I group reduced the Montreal cognitive assessment battery language tests scores 4 months before NI group. It remains to be investigated what mechanisms may explain the earlier and more intense language losses in institutionalized elderly.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 Dias de Macedo et al.

N2  - Background: With the rise in the ageing population and absence of a cure for dementia, cost-effective prevention strategies for those 'at risk' of dementia including those with depression and/or mild cognitive impairment are urgently required. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study evaluated the efficacy of a multifaceted Healthy Brain Ageing Cognitive Training (HBA-CT) program for older adults 'at risk' of dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Using a single-blinded design, 64 participants (mean age=66.5 years, SD=8.6) were randomized to an immediate treatment (HBA-CT) or treatment-as-usual control arm. The HBA-CT intervention was conducted twice-weekly for seven weeks and comprised group-based psychoeducation about cognitive strategies and modifiable lifestyle factors pertaining to healthy brain ageing, and computerized cognitive training. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In comparison to the treatment-as-usual control arm, the HBA-CT program was associated with improvements in verbal memory (p=0.03), self-reported memory (p =0.03), mood (p=0.01), and sleep (p =0.01). While the improvements in memory (p=0.03) and sleep (p=0.02) remained after controlling for improvements in mood, only a trend in verbal memory improvement was apparent after controlling for sleep. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The HBA-CT program improves cognitive, mood, and sleep functions in older adults 'at risk' of dementia, and therefore offers promise as a secondary prevention strategy.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 The authors and IOS Press.

N2  - Background: Non-pharmalogical interventions represent an important complement to standard pharmalogical treatment in dementia. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study aims to evaluate the effects of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program on cognitive ability, quality of life and depression symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND). <ovid:br/>Method(s): Ninety-seven older adults were recruited to the present study. Of these, 70 patients had mild AD and were allocated into experimental (n = 54) or control (n = 16) groups. Two additional active comparison groups were constituted with patients with moderate AD (n = 13) or with CIND (n = 14) who also received the intervention. The multidisciplinary rehabilitation program lasted for 12 weeks and was composed by sessions of memory training, recreational activities, verbal expression and writing, physical therapy and physical training, delivered in two weekly 6-hour sessions. <ovid:br/>Result(s): As compared to controls, mild AD patients who received the intervention had improvements in cognition (p = 0.021) and quality of life (p = 0.003), along with a reduction in depressive symptoms (p < 0.001). As compared to baseline, CIND patients displayed at the end of the intervention improvements in cognition (p = 0.005) and depressive symptoms (p = 0.011). No such benefits were found among patients with moderate AD. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): This multidisciplinary rehabilitation program was beneficial for patients with mild AD and CIND. However, patients with moderate dementia did not benefit from the intervention.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015, Lemos Editorial e Graficos Ltda. All rights reserved.

N2  - The combined use of cognitive activity (CA) and physical activity (PA) seems to modulate the factors associated to the incidence of mild Alzheimer. Objectives To examine the effects of a combined intervention of CA and PA on cognitive performance in the elderly with mild AD. Method Quasi-experimental design, single blind evaluation with groups comparison. Participants 80 subjects = 60 years with neurological diagnosis of mild Alzheimer's dementia, of whom 60 completed the study (19 men and 41 women). Participants were randomly divided into an intervention group (IG: n = 24, M = 71.8 years, SD = 5.5) subjected to a combined program of cognitive training and physical activity for 6 months, and a control group (CG: n = 36, M = 73.8 years, SD = 6.3) composed of sedentary subjects who didn't do any physical activity or were subjected to cognitive training during the study. Results inter and intragroup t-student tests reported significant differences in MMSE, TRCF, TAAVR and TMT-A and B for the GI, an increase in the mean performance of all dimensions evaluated after AF program and BC, in the CG. The ANCOVA reported favorable evidence of the impact of AC and AF on cognitive function of GI versus controls (f = 17,378, P<.000). Conclusions favorable results showing a significant difference in the study groups, emerging as the CA and PA improves cognitive performance of the elderly with dementia were found.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Sociedad Neurologica Argentina.

N2  - Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean +/- standard deviation age was 80.5 +/- 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 The Authors.

N2  - Background and purpose: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are at high risk for cognitive dysfunction. Non-pharmacological interventions have attracted increasing interest for enhancing PD patients' cognitive functions. <ovid:br/>Method(s): One-year follow-up data (T<ovid:inf>2</ovid:inf>) of a randomized controlled trial evaluating two 6-week cognitive trainings - a structured (NEUROvitalis, NV) and an unstructured (mentally fit, MF) program - compared with a waiting list control group (CG) in non-demented PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr I-III) are presented. Forty-seven PD patients were examined at T<ovid:inf>2</ovid:inf>. Effects on overall cognitive functions (Mini-Mental State Examination and DemTect) were compared between all groups with repeated measurement analyses of variance. A combined score of the percentage change value from baseline (T<ovid:inf>0</ovid:inf>) to T<ovid:inf>2</ovid:inf> was calculated to identify patients who retained or improved their cognitive state (responders). The risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was analyzed. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Significant time x treatment effects on overall cognitive functions were found for both training groups, each compared separately to the CG (DemTect, P < 0.05). Nine patients (56.3%) of the NV group, seven (41.2%) of the MF group and three (21.4%) of the CG were responders. Comparing NV to CG the odds ratio was 4.7 [95% confidence interval (0.8; 33.3)], and comparing MF to CG it was 2.6 [95% confidence interval (0.4; 17.4)]. MCI risk for patients without prior MCI was 40.0% in CG, 18.2% in MF and 18.2% in NV. The odds ratio was 3 comparing NV to CG, MF to CG. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): This study gives evidence that cognitive training may be effective to prevent cognitive decline and onset of MCI in PD patients.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014 EAN.

N2  - Objective: Cognitive training (CT) is a nonpharmacological intervention for elderly subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study evaluated the benefits to attention, memory, language and praxis of a computer-based CT program using the Apple iPad softwares in subjects with AD. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A prospective study was conducted with 76 elderly of both sexes with mild AD that underwent a detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessment. Subjects were evaluated at baseline and 6months after. They were divided into three groups: an experimental group (EG) received a computer based CT of 6 months duration; an active control group (AG) received health information sessions during 6 months and no intervention; and a control group (CG), which received no intervention. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The EG showed a better performance on language, attention, praxis and perception, compared to the other groups. The EG achieved a better performance in the MMSE scores with a mean increase of 2.1 points (p<0.0001). The CG and AG showed a worse performance, with a mean loss of -6.7 and -1.14 points, respectively. In addition, EG presented a discrete increase at the total score of the CAMCOG (1.1 points) compared to the other groups (p<0.0001). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This data suggests that computer based CT showed benefits to elderly with mild AD.

N2  - Background: The Gyeongbukdo cognitive training program(GBDCTP) of 80 sessions was provided for community dwelling very older adults and the effects on cognitive function, depression and quality of life were tested. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The participants were 1459 communitybased sample of 'lone' older adults from 75 to 92 years of age who have mild cognitive disorder(CDR=0.5). This program was applied two times a week for 40 weeks. The sample was randomized in two groups: 876 participants underwent full length period GBD-CTPA while 583 participants received only 20 weeks CTP and stop CTP next 20 weeks. Research tool was applied in order to verify the effects of the program on the subjects' ability toward ADL, cognitive function, and depression and quality of life. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The intervention effect( mean change from baseline to final test) was significant(P<.05) on MMSE-DS(1.32), GDS(0.3), QOL-AD(3.5), S-IADL(2.5) and Greiratric Dep Scale(4.2). Five participants(stop progressed to dementia. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These results suggest that this long term CTP has an effect on the improvement of the ability toward cognition and ADL of mild cognitive impairment living alone in a community.

N2  - Background: There are many non-pharmacological interventions proven to be effective in improving cognition, behaviors or function of dementia patients. We developed the Multimodal Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (MCET) that consists of cognitive trainings, cognitive stimulations, reality orientation, physical therapy, reminiscence therapy, and music therapy, and evaluated its' efficacy. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This study was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over study (8 weeks of treatment separated by one wash-out period of 4 weeks). Sixty four participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia whose Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) was 0.5 or 1 were allocated to the active therapy (MCET) group or the placebo (mock-therapy) group, and 54 completed the study. Diagnoses of MCI and dementia were made according to the International Working Group on MCI criteria and the Diagnostic and Statistical manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria, respectively. Primary outcome measures were the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). Secondary outcome measures were the Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire (SMCQ), Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (RMBPC), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) and Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD). All measures were administered at baseline, week 9 and week 21. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The MCET was more effective in improving the MMSE score (effect size 0.48, p=0.009), ADAS-cog (effect size 0.35, p=0.040), RMBPC positive items (Effect size 0.41, p=0.021), RMBPC frequency score (effect size 0.37, p=0.039) and QoL-AD (effect size 0.38, p=0.038). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results suggested that the MCET may be effective in improving cognition, behavioral and psychological symptoms, and quality of life of the people with MCI or early stage dementia.

N2  - Purpose/Objective(s): While there has been substantial research on radiation induced neurocognitive decline in pediatric patients, adults are also at risk. We performed a prospective study to assess cognitive outcomes up to 18 months after RT following highly conformal partial brain RT for adults with low grade brain tumors and compared results to population healthy controls. Materials/Methods: Thirty five adult patients with low grade or benign brain tumors treated with highly conformal partial brain radiation therapy (RT) between 2004 and 2013. Median dose was 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions (range 50.4-70 Gy). Patients underwent neurocognitive testing prior to RT and 1, 6, and 18 months after RT. No patients had disease progression; loss to follow-up was due to voluntary dropout. Tests included the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), a test of general cognitive performance; the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Total score (HVLT-Total) and Percent Retained score (-Percent Retained), measures of immediate and short-term verbal recall; the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), a measure of verbal fluency; and Trail Making Tests A and B (TMT-A and -B), measures of visual scanning speed and executive function. After converting results to Z scores based on age, sex, and education normative values, a standardized regression based formula was used to determine significant changes in performance taking into account expected individual intertest correlation and practice effect. <ovid:br/>Result(s): At baseline, the group average performance was significantly below population norms for immediate verbal recall (HVLT-Total) and verbal fluency (COWAT) (p < 0.01). Group average performance significantly declined for short-term verbal recall (HVLT-Percent Retained) (p= 0.04) and verbal fluency (p < 0.001) at 1 month after RT, with later recovery. Visual scanning and executive function (TMT-A and -B) significantly declined at all timepoints after RT (p < 0.03). At 18 months after RT, no remaining patients showed significant decline on the MMSE or HVLT-Total, 5% of patients showed a decline on the COWAT, 10% showed decline on the HVLT-Percent Retained, 32% showed decline on the TMTA, and 67% showed impairment on the TMT-B. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Visual scanning speed and executive function were most commonly and persistently affected by RT, while verbal short-term recall and fluency showed transient worsening. Future studies should emphasize testing in these domains of neurocognitive functioning and cognitive rehabilitation should focus on these skills. Consistent with previous studies, the Mini-Mental State Exam was not sensitive to radiation induced cognitive decline and should not be used alone as a measure of cognitive function. Additional studies with follow-up beyond 18 months should be conducted to determine long term outcomes.

N2  - Background: Post-stroke aphasia is usually accompanied by cognitive disorder, which affects overall rehabilitation. We investigated the effect of cognitive intervention on language function and quality of life (QOL) in elderly patients with post-stroke aphasia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Fifty-five elderly patients (aged >= 60 years) with post-stroke aphasia were randomly divided into the control group (n = 27) and the experimental group (n = 28). The control group received comprehensive treatment including speech-language therapy (SLT), while the experimental group was subjected to additional cognitive intervention. All patients were enrolled in an eight-week rehabilitation program. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function, and a device for diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, ZM2.1, was used to evaluate language function, and the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) (Chinese version) was used to assess quality of life (QOL), before and after treatment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After treatment, MMSE scores, language function scores in all categories and QOL scores in all dimensions were improved in both groups (P <.05 for both). Furthermore, after treatment, there were significant differences between the two groups in MMSE scores of orientation, recall, attention and calculation, and in scores of overall language ability and the individual categories (P <.05 for all). Scores of the experimental group vs the control group for the individual categories of language function were as follows: simple instructions (76.6+/-14.1 vs 67.4+/-19.3), complex instructions (66.1+/-12.8 vs 58.2+/-14.9), yes or no (72.5+/-12.1 vs 63.0+/-14.1), naming (55.0+/-19.5 vs 43.3+/-22.2), simple comprehension (67.5+/-21.4 vs 55.6+/-20.6), complex comprehension (44.8+/-17.0 vs 35.0+/-18.9), listening and reading words (65.4+/-16.7 vs53.7+/-19.3), calculation (39.3+/-25.8 vs 25.9+/-19.2), memory (36.4+/-18.7 vs 26.3+/-17.8), matching (75.9+/-18.6 vs 65.3+/-17.1), simple general knowledge (68.3+/-18.2 vs 58.0+/-19.5), complex general knowledge (58.7+/-17.4 vs 50.0+/-13.3), orientation (70.7+/-19.6 vs 60.5+/-17.2) and comparison (59.9+/-14.6 vs 50.2+/-17.5) (P <.05 for all). There were significant differences between the two groups in emotional function (66.7+/-18.2 vs 53.1+/-21.2), general health (67.2+/-12.6 vs 60.7+/-9.8), mental health (71.0+/-5.6 vs 63.1+/-4.2), social functioning (64.7+/-9.0 vs 59.3+/-10.2) and vitality (55.4+/-14.8 vs 46.9+/-15.6) (P <.05 for all). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Cognitive intervention combined with SLT can contribute to the recovery of language function and improvement of QOL in elderly patients with post-stroke aphasia.

N2  - Objectives: FINGER successfully demonstrated that a multidomain intervention can prevent cognitive decline. We investigated whether the intervention also affected health-related quality of life (HRQoL). <ovid:br/>Method(s): 1260 community-dwelling individuals aged 60 to 77 years at risk of cognitive decline were randomized to intervention (I, n = 631) and control (C), n = 629) groups. Two-year intervention included healthy diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk management and monitoring. HRQoL was assessed at baseline, 12, and 24 months using RAND-36 (SF-36) instrument, which includes 8 scales: Physical Function (PF), Role Physical (RP), Role mental (RM), Vitality (VT), Mental Health (MH), Social Function (SF), Bodily Pain (BP), and General Health (GH). The changes in scales were adjusted for age, sex, education, and MMSE. <ovid:br/>Result(s): At baseline, the scores in all RAND-36 scales were considerably higher in the FINGER participants compared with Finnish population of similar age. During the 2-year intervention period mean scores in all scales decreased in C, but increased in I for VT (12 and 24 months), SF (12 months), and especially GH at both 12 and 24 months. The differences between I and C groups were significant for GH at 12 (P < 0.001) and 24 months (P < 0.001), PF at 12 months (P < 0.01), and RP at 12 months (P = 0.03). The net differences in GH scores between groups were >3 points, which is considered clinically meaningful in RAND-36. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In the FINGER study with good HRQoL at baseline, multidomain intervention to prevent cognitive decline had also positive effect on some scales of RAND-36, especially general health.

N2  - Although some studies point to cognitive stimulation as a beneficial therapy for older adults with cognitive impairments, this area of research and practice is still lacking dissemination and is underrepresented in many countries. Moreover, the comparative effects of different intervention durations remain to be established and, besides cognitive effects, pragmatic parameters, such as cost-effectiveness and experiential relevance to participants, are seldom explored. In this work, we present a randomized controlled wait-list trial evaluating 2 different intervention durations (standard = 17 vs brief = 11 sessions) of a cognitive stimulation program developed for older adults with cognitive impairments with or without dementia. 20 participants were randomly assigned to the standard duration intervention program (17 sessions, 1.5 months) or to a wait-list group. At postintervention of the standard intervention group, the wait-list group crossed over to receive the brief intervention program (11 sessions, 1 month). Changes in neuropsychological, functionality, quality of life, and caregiver outcomes were evaluated. Experience during intervention and costs and feasibility were also evaluated. The current cognitive stimulation programs (ie, standard and brief) showed high values of experiential relevance for both intervention durations. High adherence, completion rates, and reasonable costs were found for both formats. Further studies are needed to definitively establish the potential efficacy, optimal duration, cost-effectiveness, and experiential relevance for participants of cognitive intervention approaches.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2014.

N2  - Primary objective: To examine the effect of cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) on psychosocial outcomes in Argentinean patients with acquired brain injury (ABI), in connection with the time elapsed between injury and treatment initiation., Research design: Self-reported data from patients in a naturalistic setting was collected before and after CRT. Methods and procedure: An outpatient sample of 75 Spanish-speaking patients with cognitive disturbances secondary to ABI (49 male/26 female, age: 50.2 +/- 20.1 years; education 14.3 +/- 3.2 years) completed a set of scales on their daily living activities, memory self-perception, quality-of-life and mood. Single and multi-group analyses were conducted, considering pre- and post- responses and the time elapsed between injury and treatment initiation. The influence of socio-demographic moderators was controlled during comparisons., Main results: Results suggest an improvement in several psychosocial indicators after treatment. Additionally, correlations and group comparisons showed greater improvement in subjective memory and quality-of-life self-reports in patients who began treatment earlier than those who began treatment after a longer time period., Conclusions: Overall, results suggest that CRT is associated with positive results in different areas of the psychosocial domain and that post-injury time can mediate this effect.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Objectives To compare the effects of different types of physical and mental activity on self-reported sleep quality over 12 weeks in older adults with cognitive and sleep complaints., Design Randomized controlled trial., Setting General community., Participants Seventy-two inactive community-dwelling older adults with self-reported sleep and cognitive problems (mean age 73.3 +/- 6.1; 60% women). Intervention Random allocation to four arms using a two-by-two factorial design: aerobic+cognitive training, aerobic+educational DVD, stretching+cognitive training, and stretching+educational DVD arms (60 min/d, 3 d/wk for physical and mental activity for 12 weeks)., Measurements Change in sleep quality using seven questions from the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire on the 2005 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (range 0-28, with higher scores reflecting worse sleep quality). Analyses used intention-to-treat methods., Results Sleep quality scores did not differ at baseline, but there was a significant difference between the study arms in change in sleep quality over time (P <.005). Mean sleep quality scores improved significantly more in the stretching+educational DVD arm (5.1 points) than in the stretching+cognitive training (1.2 points), aerobic+educational DVD (1.1 points), or aerobic+cognitive training (0.25 points) arms (all P <.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Differences between arms were strongest for waking at night (P =.02) and taking sleep medications (P =.004)., Conclusion Self-reported sleep quality improved significantly more with low-intensity physical and mental activities than with moderate- or high-intensity activities in older adults with self-reported cognitive and sleep difficulties. Future longer-term studies with objective sleep measures are needed to corroborate these results.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014, The American Geriatrics Society.

N2  - Objective We evaluated the feasibility of a trial of Wii interactive video gaming, and its potential efficacy at improving cognitive functioning compared with health education, in a community sample of older adults with neuropsychologically defined mild cognitive impairment. Methods Twenty older adults were equally randomized to either group-based interactive video gaming or health education for 90 min each week for 24 weeks. Although the primary outcomes were related to study feasibility, we also explored the effect of the intervention on neuropsychological performance and other secondary outcomes. Results All 20 participants completed the intervention, and 18 attended at least 80% of the sessions. The majority (80%) of participants were "very much" satisfied with the intervention. Bowling was enjoyed by the most participants and was also rated the highest among the games for mental, social, and physical stimulation. We observed medium effect sizes for cognitive and physical functioning in favor of the interactive video gaming condition, but these effects were not statistically significant in this small sample. Conclusion Interactive video gaming is feasible for older adults with mild cognitive impairment, and medium effect sizes in favor of the Wii group warrant a larger efficacy trial.

N2  - The main study objective was to investigate the effect of interactive television-based cognitive training on cognitive performance of 119 healthy older adults, aged 60-87 years. Participants were randomly allocated to a cognitive training group or to an active control group in a single-blind controlled two-group design. Before and after training interactive television cognitive performance was assessed on well validated tests of fluid, higher-order ability, and system usability was evaluated. The participants in the cognitive training group completed a television-based cognitive training programme, while the participants in the active control group completed a TV-based programme of personally benefiting activities. Significant improvements were observed in well validated working memory and executive function tasks in the cognitive training but not in the control group. None of the groups showed statistically significant improvement in life satisfaction score. Participants' reports of "adequate" to "high" system usability testify to the successful development and implementation of the interactive television-based system and compliant cognitive training contents. The study demonstrates that cognitive training delivered by means of an interactive television system can generate genuine cognitive benefits in users and these are measurable using well-validated cognitive tests. Thus, older adults who cannot use or afford a computer can easily use digital interactive television to benefit from advanced software applications designed to train cognition. &#xa9; 2014 Shatil et al.

N2  - Purpose of the study: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a widely used, evidence-based intervention for people with dementia (PwD). Although designed as a 14 session, twice weekly intervention, many services in the UK deliver CST once a week for 14 weeks. However, this method of delivery has yet to be evaluated. In addition, CST does not include any formal carer training. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of once weekly CST and determine any additional impact when enhanced with a carer training program., Design and methods: A single blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Sixty eight PwD and their carers were recruited through three community Memory Assessment Services. PwD and their carers were randomized to one of three conditions: CST plus carer training, CST only, or a wait list control. PwD were administered standardized measures of cognition, quality of life, and quality of relationship with carer at baseline and the 15 week follow-up., Results: There were no baseline differences across the three groups. At follow-up, there were no significant differences between PwD in the three groups on any outcomes., Implications: Weekly CST with or without carer training may not be an effective form of delivery. Several possible explanations for the outcomes are proposed. Weekly CST may not offer the necessary "dose" required to combat decline, and equally the carer training may have been too brief to have made a difference. Services currently offering weekly CST should collect routine outcome data to support its use and provide practice-based evidence.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Cove et al.

N2  - Background: This pilot study compared the effects of lexical-semantic stimulation through telecommunication technology (LSS-tele) with in-person LSS (LSS-direct) and unstructured cognitive treatment (UCS) in patients with early Alzheimer's disease., Methods: Twenty-seven patients with Alzheimer's disease in the very early stage (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] >26/30) were divided into three groups: seven patients received LSS-tele treatment, ten received standard LSS-direct intervention, and ten participants underwent UCS as control condition. Intervention treatments consisted of two weekly sessions of LSS (through teleconference or face to face depending on group assignment) or UCS exercises administered to small groups throughout a 3-month period. The main outcome measures were changes of global cognitive performance, language abilities, and memory function. Secondary outcome measures were changes in attention, working memory, executive functions, and visual-spatial abilities tests., Results: The mean MMSE score improved significantly in LSS-tele and LSS-direct treatments; LSS-tele improved language abilities, both phonemic and semantic, and stabilized delayed verbal episodic memory with respect to an improved performance after the LSS-direct intervention and to a memory decline observed in the control group. Improvement was not achieved in any neuropsychological test score after UCS., Conclusion: Clinical application of telecommunication technology to cognitive rehabilitation of elderly patients with neurodegenerative cognitive impairment is feasible and may improve global cognitive performance. Technical aspects to ameliorate efficacy of delivery may further improve its impact on domain-specific cognitive abilities.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Jelcic et al.

N2  - With a longer life expectancy and an increased prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, investigations on trajectories of cognitive aging have become exciting and promising. This study aimed to estimate the patterns of age-related cognitive decline and the potential associated factors of cognitive function in community-dwelling residents of Beijing, China. In this study, 1248 older adults aged 52-88 years [including 175 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects] completed a battery of neuropsychological scales. The personal information, including demographic information, medical history, eating habits, lifestyle regularity and leisure activities, was also collected. All cognitive function exhibited an agerelated decline in normal volunteers. Piece-wise linear fitting results suggested that performance on the Auditory Verbal Learning Test remained stable until 58 years of age and continued to decline thereafter. The decline in processing speed and executive function began during the early 50's. Scores on visual-spatial and language tests declined after 66 years of age. The decline stage of the general mental status ranged from 63 to 70 years of age. However, the MCI group did not exhibit an obvious age-related decline in most cognitive tests. Multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that education, gender, leisure activities, diabetes and eating habits were associated with cognitive abilities. These results indicated various trajectories of age-related decline across multiple cognitive domains. We also found different patterns of agerelated cognitive decline between MCI and normal elderly. These findings could help improve the guidance of cognitive intervention program and have implications for public policy issues.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Background: Stroke is one of the most common causes of cognitive impairment. Up to 75% of stroke survivors may be considered to have cognitive impairment, which severely limit individual autonomy for successful reintegration into family, work and social life. The clinical efficacy of acupuncture with Baihui (DU20) and Shenting (DU24) in stroke and post-stroke cognitive impairment has been previously demonstrated. Computer-assisted cognitive training is part of conventional cognitive rehabilitation and has also shown to be effective in improvement of cognitive function of affected patients. However, the cognitive impairment after stroke is so complexity that one single treatment cannot resolve effectively. Besides, the effects of acupuncture and RehaCom cognitive training have not been systematically compared, nor has the possibility of a synergistic effect of combination of the two therapeutic modalities been evaluated. Our primary aim of this trial is to evaluate the synergistic effect of acupuncture and RehaCom cognitive training on cognitive dysfunction after stroke.Method/Design: A randomized controlled trial of 2 x 2 factorial design will be conducted in the Rehabilitation Hospital Affiliated to Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. A total of 240 patients with cognitive dysfunction after stroke who meet the eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomized into RehaCom training group, acupuncture group, a combination of both or control group in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. All patients will receive conventional treatment. The interventions will last for 12 weeks (30 min per day, Monday to Friday every week). Evaluations will be conducted by blinded assessors at baseline and again at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Outcome measurements include mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessments (MoCA), functional independence measure scale (FIM) and adverse events. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): The results of this trial are expected to clarify the synergistic effect of acupuncture and RehaCom cognitive training on cognitive dysfunction after stroke. Furthermore, to confirm whether combined or alone of acupuncture and RehaCom cognitive training, is more effective than conventional treatment in the management of post-stroke cognitive dysfunction.Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR-TRC-13003704.Registration date: 4 September, 2013.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - The aim of the present report was to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of multisensory and cognitive stimulation on improving cognition in elderly persons living in long-term-care institutions (institutionalized [I]) or in communities with their families (noninstitutionalized [NI]). We compared neuropsychological performance using language and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test scores before and after 24 and 48 stimulation sessions. The two groups were matched by age and years of schooling. Small groups of ten or fewer volunteers underwent the stimulation program, twice a week, over 6 months (48 sessions in total). Sessions were based on language and memory exercises, as well as visual, olfactory, auditory, and ludic stimulation, including music, singing, and dance. Both groups were assessed at the beginning (before stimulation), in the middle (after 24 sessions), and at the end (after 48 sessions) of the stimulation program. Although the NI group showed higher performance in all tasks in all time windows compared with I subjects, both groups improved their performance after stimulation. In addition, the improvement was significantly higher in the I group than the NI group. Language tests seem to be more efficient than the MMSE to detect early changes in cognitive status. The results suggest the impoverished environment of long-term-care institutions may contribute to lower cognitive scores before stimulation and the higher improvement rate of this group after stimulation. In conclusion, language tests should be routinely adopted in the neuropsychological assessment of elderly subjects, and long-term-care institutions need to include regular sensorimotor, social, and cognitive stimulation as a public health policy for elderly persons. &#xa9; 2014 De Oliveira et al.

N2  - Objectives: To examine the effects of cognitive stimulation (mahjong) and physical exercise (tai chi [TC]) on cognitive performance in persons with dementia. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Cluster-randomized open-label controlled design. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): Nursing homes. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): One hundred ten residents,most ofwhomwere cholinesterase-inhibitor naive. Inclusion criteria were Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) = 10-24 and suffering from at least very mild dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating >= 0.5). Exclusion criteria were being bedbound, audio/visual impairment, regular activity participation before study, or contraindications for physical or group activities. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): Homes were randomized into three conditions (mahjong, TC, and simple handicrafts [control]). Activities were conducted three times weekly for 12 weeks. Measurements: Primary outcome was MMSE. Secondary outcomes were immediate/delayed recall, categorical fluency, and digit span. Various biological risk factors, including apolipoprotein E e4 allele, were included as covariates. Measures were collected at 0 (baseline), 3 (posttreatment), 6, and 9 months. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Intent-to-treat analyses were performed using mixed-effects regression. Mahjong's effect varied by time for MMSE, delayed recall, and forward digit span. TC had similar effects but not for delayed recall. The typical pattern was that control participants deteriorated while mahjong and TC participants maintained their abilities over time, leading to enlarged treatment effects as time progressed. By 9 months, mahjong and TC differed from control by 4.5 points (95% confidence interval: 2.0-6.9; d = 0.48) and 3.7 points (95% confidence interval: 1.4-6.0; d = 0.40), respectively, on MMSE. No treatment effects were observed for immediate recall and backward digit span. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Mahjong and TC can preserve functioning or delay decline in certain cognitive domains, even in those with significant cognitive impairment. &#xa9; 2014 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the long-term effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the bilateral prefrontal cortex combined with computer-assisted cognitive training on working memory and cognitive function in healthy older adults aged at least 65 years. Forty healthy older adults were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups: anodal and sham tDCS. All participants completed 10 sessions of computer-assisted cognitive training, combined with tDCS of the bilateral prefrontal cortex. The accuracy of the verbal working memory task and performance of the digit span forward test were significantly improved after computer-assisted cognitive training combined with bifrontal anodal tDCS as compared with that after computer-assisted cognitive training combined with sham tDCS. Moreover, the effect lasts for 4 weeks in the verbal working memory task. We suggest that the tDCS-induced changes in the bilateral prefrontal excitability during computer-assisted cognitive training may have beneficial effects on age-related cognitive decrement in healthy older adults.&#xa9; 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health <ovid:br/> Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

T1  - Reasoning exercises in assisted living: A cluster randomized trial to improve reasoning and everyday problem solving
A1  - Williams K.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Purpose of the study: Assisted living (AL) residents are at risk for cognitive and functional declines that eventually reduce their ability to care for themselves, thereby triggering nursing home placement. In developing a method to slow this decline, the efficacy of Reasoning Exercises in Assisted Living (REAL), a cognitive training intervention that teaches everyday reasoning and problem-solving skills to AL residents, was tested. Design and methods: At thirteen randomized Midwestern facilities, AL residents whose Mini Mental State Examination scores ranged from 19-29 either were trained in REAL or a vitamin education attention control program or received no treatment at all. For 3 weeks, treated groups received personal training in their respective programs. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Scores on the Every Day Problems Test for Cognitively Challenged Elders (EPCCE) and on the Direct Assessment of Functional Status (DAFS) showed significant increases only for the REAL group. For EPCCE, change from baseline immediately postintervention was +3.10 (P<0.01), and there was significant retention at the 3-month follow-up (d=2.71; P<0.01). For DAFS, change from baseline immediately postintervention was +3.52 (P<0.001), although retention was not as strong. Neither the attention nor the no-treatment control groups had significant gains immediately postintervention or at follow-up assessments. Post hoc across-group comparison of baseline change also highlights the benefits of REAL training. For EPCCE, the magnitude of gain was significantly larger in the REAL group versus the no-treatment control group immediately postintervention (d=3.82; P<0.01) and at the 3-month follow-up (d=3.80; P<0.01). For DAFS, gain magnitude immediately postintervention for REAL was significantly greater compared with in the attention control group (d=4.73; P<0.01). Implications: REAL improves skills in everyday problem solving, which may allow AL residents to maintain self-care and extend AL residency. This benefit is particularly important given the growing population of AL residents at risk for cognitive and self-care decline. &#xa9; 2014 Williams et al.

N2  - Background: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from impaired gait and mobility. These changes in motor function have been associated with cognitive deficits that also commonly co-occur in PD, especially executive function (EF) and attention. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): We hypothesized that a cognitive remediation program would enhance gait and mobility. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The 18 PD patients in this study were assessed at baseline and again one and four weeks after completion of a 12 week long, home-based computerized cognitive training program. Subjects were asked to 'play' computer games designed to improve EF and attention for 30 minutes a day, three times per week for 12 weeks, while seated. The Timed Up and Go (TUG), gait speed, and stride time variability quantified mobility. A previously validated, computerized neuropsychological battery quantified global cognitive function and its sub-domains. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Compared to pre-training values, global cognitive scores and time to complete the TUG significantly improved after the training. TUG components of turning speed and duration also improved. Other TUG components, gait speed, and variability did not change after training. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These initial findings suggest that computerized cognitive training can improve cognitive function and has a beneficial carryover effect to certain aspects of mobility in patients with PD. Additional studies are required to replicate these findings and more fully assess the underlying mechanisms. Nonetheless, the present results underscore the motor-cognitive link in PD and suggest that computerized cognitive training may be applied as a therapeutic option to enhance mobility in patients with PD. &#xa9; 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

T1  - What is the evidence for changes in cognition and functioning over the lifespan in patients with schizophrenia?
A1  - Harvey P.D.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are important predictors of impairment in most functional domains and are a critical therapeutic target. These deficits appear at or before the onset of illness, are stable across time in most patients, and can be improved by cognitive remediation treatments. Recent evidence, however, suggests that cognitive function does not necessarily follow a pattern of age-related decline. Several studies evaluated this pattern of decline in schizophrenia patients compared to both natural aging and degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Age-related differences were not comparable to either normal aging or Alzheimer's disease. Older patients with an extensive history of illness and protracted institutionalization have shown a greater progressive decline. These deficits were also observed in older patients who were no longer institutionalized, with these patients demonstrating decline in functional capacity across time compared to healthy controls and patients with no lengthy institutional stay. There were 2 clear conclusions from this body of data. First, there appear to be 2 separate periods of deterioration in schizophrenia patients. These patients appear to decline the most at 2 key time points; the first occurs some time prior to the first psychotic episode and the second begins at approximately 65 years of age. The second important conclusion is that these 2 important periods of time may be the time point at which an aggressive intervention may have the greatest impact. &#xa9; Copyright 2014 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

N2  - Introduction Dementia has a growing global health, social and economic impact. While there is ongoing research on pharmacotherapy, non-pharmacological interventions are cost-effective, associated with fewer side effects, adaptable at an earlier age and more likely to prove acceptable to the elderly in helping counteract cognitive decline. Mindfulness programmes have gained increasing recognition in improving physical health, psychological and emotional well-being (Mcbee, 2008). These are thought to be mediated via neural plasticity mechanisms, enhanced immune response and changes in gene expression and activity (Creswell, 2014). Mindfulness involves mental training in focusing on the "present moment, non-judgmentally" (Kabat-Zinn, 1994 and Bishop et al, 2004). This study investigates the efficacy of Mindful Awareness Practice or MAP (Wee, Doshi & Chow, 2014) in improving cognitive function in the elderly. Methods In a randomised controlled trial, 55 elderly individuals (aged 60 to 85 years) assessed with mild cognitive impairment have been entered in 2 study arms, the active Mindfulness Awareness Practice and the control arm, a Health Education Programme. NUS IRB (Ref Code B-14-110) gave ethics approval. The study is in 2 phases, a weekly 3-month phase and then a monthly 6-month phase. Assessments are done at baseline, 3-months and at 9-months. They include: (i) Structural MRI at baseline and 3 months; (ii) Assessment for anxiety and depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory; (iii) Neuropsychological tests for cognitive functioning, the Mini Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span Test, Color Trails Test, Block Design, Semantic Verbal Fluency; (iv) Biological samples of blood for cytokine, chromosomal studies and terminal telomere restriction fragment length analysis, urine for oxidative biomarkers, saliva for cortisol and cytokine analysis and faeces for bacterial analysis. Basic health screening and demographic data are also collected. The MAP intervention is delivered by a trained practitioner and consists of 40-minute sessions weekly for 3 months and tracked self-practice at home, in-between these sessions. The planned sessions introduce the elderly to mindfulness practice in a graduated manner. The extension of sessions for 6 months is to determine sustainability and longer-term changes. The MAP is designed to foster awareness of internal states and promote positive mental and physical health through mindful awareness in daily activities. The control arm participates in similar 40-minute sessions but will receive a Health Education Programme with a focus on information on hypertension, diabetes, dementia, depression, medications, exercise, diet, sleep, home safety, falls and social support. Conclusion This RCT is the first study to investigate systematically the efficacy of a psychosocial and non-invasive intervention, Mindful Awareness Practice, and the multiple pathways through which this intervention could potentially counteract mental deterioration and enhance mental resilience. The study has tremendous potential for supporting cognitive training programmes and applicability to larger populations of the elderly.

N2  - Background: It was well known that cognitive training has been shown to improve cognitive abilities in older adults and patient with dementia but the effect of cognitive training and life style modification on every day to dementia have not been demonstrated. The purpose of this article was to know efficiency of utilization of the regional center for dementia to dementia and the effectiveness of multi-divisional-programming of the regional center for dementia to prevent cognitive decline in dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Six hundred fifty six patients with dementia and mild cognitive impairment were recommended medical treatment and cognitive intervention programs through Seongdong-gu center for dementia. Totally 52 patients were actively participated in cognitive intervention program. Patients were allocated according to agreement of cognitive program, 32 patients agree with participation of cognitive program of Seongdong-gu center for dementia along with the medicine (combined treatment group) and 22 patients received medical therapy alone(medical treatment group). The Korean version of Mini-Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE) and CERAD-K were done to evaluate cognitive improvement within 6 months. Comparison between combined treatment group and medical treatment group were done by using K-MMSE and CERAD-K. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There was significant improvement of K-MMSE score in combined treatment group through regional center for dementia. Frontal executive function and word memory recognition test were maintained and improved in the combined treatment group than in the medical treatment group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Multi-divisional cognitive programs might affect the cognitive improvement in mild dementia patients and might slow the progression of dementia. These results might reflect the effectiveness of a variety of the interventional program through the regional center for dementia to prevent the progression in the dementia patients.

N2  - Background: Observational studies show that modifiable vascular and lifestyle- related risk factors are associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Interventions upon modifiable risk factors may prevent/postpone dementia onset, but evidence from intervention trials is lacking. Furthermore, very little information is available on the participation and non-participation in intervention trials. The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) tests the hypothesis that a multidomain intervention consisting of nutritional guidance, exercise training, cognitive training and intensive monitoring of vascular risk factors will prevent cognitive impairment. Here we report the details of study recruitment, and characteristics of both participants and non-participants of the trial. <ovid:br/>Method(s): FINGER study is a 2-year multicentre randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited from previous population-based non-intervention studies. The inclusion criteria were age 60-77, CAIDE dementia risk score >6 indicating presence of modifiable risk factors, and cognitive performance at the mean level or slightly lower than expected for age. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 5496 participants were invited to participate, 48 % of them came to the screening visit, 1260 participants were eligible and were randomized to intervention (n=631) and control (n=629) groups. Those who did not come to the screening visit were slightly older, less educated, had more vascular risk factors present and were less physically active in the previous study than the persons who participated. At the baseline assessment the mean age of the randomized participants was 69.3 years, 47 % were women, mean MMSE was 27 points, systolic blood pressure 140.2 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 80.4 mmHg, total serum cholesterol level 5.2 mmol/l and fasting glucose level 6.1 mmol/l. The baseline characteristics of the participants in the intervention and control groups were similar. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Vascular risk factors were more common among those who did not come to the screening visit than among those came. However, several modifiable risk factors were present at baseline also among the participants indicating a window of opportunity for the intervention. FINGER study will be completed in 2014, and it is expected to provide important information on the effect of lifestyle intervention to prevent cognitive impairment.

N2  - Project Description: Although exercise and cognitive activity are promising strategies for preventing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that a specific physical or cognitive training program should be prescribed. In this 6-month RCT, participants without probable dementia were randomized (n = 44) to either exercise intervention (E-I) or exercise control (E-C). Both groups: (1) accumulated a minimum of 150 minutes of exercise each week, of which at least 120 minutes was from a standard exercise program that emphasized aerobic exercise; and (2) completed 45-minutes of Square Stepping Exercise (SSE) each week (beginner protocols only). The E-I group also answered cognitively challenging questions while doing SSE. Assessments were conducted at baseline (V0), 3-months (V1) and 6-months (V2). Multiple linear regression models with generalized estimating equations were used to examine differences between groups in mean change of standardized z scores for executive function (EF; primary outcome), verbal learning and memory, verbal fluency, processing speed, and global cognitive functioning. At V0, participants who completed the 6-month intervention [n=37, mean age 72.8 (SD 7.3) y, 68% female] had mean MMSE and MoCA scores of 28.8 (SD 1.3) and 24.9 (SD 1.9), respectively. For our primary outcome EF, there were no differences between groups in mean change from V0 to V1 or V2. For 3 out of 4 of our secondary outcomes, the E-I group improved to a greater extent than the E-C group: verbal learning & memory (V0 to V1: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.03-0.69, p=0.03; V0 to V2: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.04-0.70, p=0.03), verbal fluency (V0 to V1: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.11-0.75, p=0.008; V0 to V2: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.29-1.01, p<0.001), and global cognitive functioning (V0 to V1: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.02-0.39, p=0.03; V0 to V2: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.04- 0.42, p=0.02). Over time, there were no differences between groups in processing speed. Results from this pilot study indicate that a multiple-modality and mind-motor exercise program can improve global cognitive functioning, specifically verbal learning and memory as well as verbal fluency, to a greater extent than a multiple-modality exercise program alone, in community- dwelling older adults without probable dementia.

N2  - Objective: To analyze the effects of physical and no physical exercise interventions on cognitive functions in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. <ovid:br/>Background(s): Decline in cognitive functions can be included as cardinal signs/symptoms of PD. Cognitive functions in this population have been affected to physical exercise interventions. However, none study compared the physical exercise interventions in relation to cognitive intervention. <ovid:br/>Method(s): One hundred and twenty PD patients (68.8+/-8.6 years old) were randomly assigned into three groups: (i) functional capacity exercises (n=40); (ii) mobility program (n=40); and (iii) cognitive intervention (n=40). Patients were in mild to moderate disease stages (1 to 3 of Hohen & Yahr and 41+/-16 points in the UPDRS) and had the cognitive functions preserved (Mini-Mental State Examination=27.8+/-2.3 points). The clinical and cognitive functions were assessed before, after 4 and 8 months of intervention. All assessments and practice sessions were done in on-medication state. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Only participants that completed 70% of the practice sessions and all assessments were included in the analysis: (i) functional capacity exercises (n=37); (ii) mobility program (n=32); and (iii) cognitive intervention (n=34). There were neither group differences nor group and moment interactions for any dependent variable. Univariate analysis for moment revealed differences in attention, mental flexibility and memory. Participants increased the score in symbol search (p<0.01), decreased the perseverative errors (p<0.01) and showed higher performance in episodic declarative memory (p<0.001) and immediate memory (p<0.002) from pre to 4 and to 8 months of intervention. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These results indicate that cognitive functions in PD patients can be improved not only with specific cognitive activities but also with physical exercise.

N2  - In Hong Kong, the evidence for cognitive-training programs in fighting against memory complaints is lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Active Mind cognitive-training program in improving the cognitive function and quality of life (QoL) for local community-dwelling Chinese older adults. A total of 200 subjects were recruited from 20 different district elderly community centers (DECCs). Centers were randomly assigned into either the intervention group or control group. The intervention group underwent eight 1-hour sessions of cognitive training, while the control group were included in the usual group activities provided by the DECCs. Standardized neuropsychological tests (the Chinese version of Mattis Dementia Rating Scale [CDRS] and the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination) and the QoL questionnaire SF12 were used to assess participants' cognitive function and QoL before and after the trial. A total of 176 subjects completed the study. The intervention group showed greater improvement in the cognitive function measured by total CDRS score (treatment: 12.24 +/- 11.57 vs control: 4.37 +/- 7.99; P < 0.001) and QoL measured by total SF12 score (treatment: 7.82 +/- 13.19 vs control: 3.18 +/- 11.61; P = 0.014). Subjects with lower education level were associated with better cognitive response to the cognitive-training program. The current findings indicated that the Active Mind cognitive-training program was effective in improving the cognitive function and QoL for community-dwelling Chinese older adults in Hong Kong. &#xa9; 2013 Kwok et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

T1  - The role of cognitive flexibility in cognitive restructuring skill acquisition among older adults

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Cognitive flexibility is one aspect of executive functioning that encompasses the ability to produce diverse ideas, consider response alternatives, and modify behaviors to manage changing circumstances. These processes are likely to be important for implementing cognitive restructuring. The present study investigated the impact of cognitive flexibility on older adults' ability to learn cognitive restructuring. Neuropsychological measures of cognitive flexibility were administered to 40 normal community-dwelling older adult volunteers and their ability to implement cognitive restructuring was coded and analyzed. Results indicated that the majority of participants showed good cognitive restructuring skill acquisition with brief training. The multiple regression analysis suggested that those with poorer cognitive flexibility on neuropsychological testing demonstrated poorer quality cognitive restructuring. In particular, perseverative thinking styles appear to negatively impact the ability to learn cognitive restructuring. Further research is needed to clarify whether older adults with poor cognitive flexibility can improve their cognitive restructuring skills with repetition over treatment or whether alternative skills should be considered. &#xa9; 2012 .

T1  - Mental exercises for cognitive function: Clinical evidence
A1  - Kawashima R.
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the beneficial effects of a new cognitive intervention program designed for the care and prevention of dementia, namely Learning Therapy. The training program used systematized basic problems in arithmetic and Japanese language as training tasks. In study 1, 16 individuals in the experimental group and 16 in the control group were recruited from a nursing home. In both groups, all individuals were clinically diagnosed with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. In study 2, we performed a single-blind, randomized controlled trial in our cognitive intervention program of 124 community-dwelling seniors. In both studies, the daily training program using reading and arithmetic tasks was carried out approximately 5 days a week, for 15 to 20 minutes a day in the intervention groups. Neuropsychological measures were determined simultaneously in the groups both prior to and after six months of the intervention. The results of our investigations indicate that our cognitive intervention using reading and arithmetic problems demonstrated a transfer effect and they provide convincing evidence that cognitive training maintains and improves the cognitive functions of dementia patients and healthy seniors.

N2  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between normal aging and dementia. Identifying this condition would allow early interventions that may reduce the rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined the efficacy of a six-month cognitive intervention program (CIP) in patients with MCI and to assess patients' condition at one-year follow-up. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Forty-six MCI participants assessed with neuropsychological, neurological, neuropsychiatry, and functional procedures were included in this study and followed up during a year. The sample was randomized into two subgroups: 24 participants (the trained group) underwent the CIP during six months while 22 (control group) received no treatment. Sixteen participants dropped out of the study. The intervention focused on teaching cognitive strategies, cognitive training, and use of external aids, in sessions of two hours, twice per week for six months. Cognitive and functional measures were used as primary outcome and all were followed up at one year. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The intervention effect (mean change from baseline) was significant (p < 0.05) on the Mini-Mental State Examination (1.74), the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (0.14), the Boston Naming Test (2.92), block design (-13.66), matrix reasoning (-3.07), and semantic fluency (-3.071) tasks. Four patients (one trained and three controls) progressed to dementia after one year of follow-up. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These results suggest that persons with MCI can improve their performance on cognitive and functional measures when provided with early cognitive training and it could persist in a long-term follow-up. &#xa9; 2013 International Psychogeriatric Association.

N2  - Objective: Age-related deficits in selective attention are hypothesized to result from decrements in inhibition of task-irrelevant information. Speed of processing (SOP) training is an adaptive cognitive intervention designed to enhance processing speed for attention tasks. The effectiveness of SOP training to improve cognitive and everyday functional performance is well documented. However, underlying mechanisms of these training benefits are unknown. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Participants completed a visual search task evaluated using event-related potentials (ERPs) before and after 10. weeks of SOP training or no contact. N2pc and P3b components were evaluated to determine SOP training effects on attentional resource allocation and capacity. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Selective attention to a target was enhanced after SOP training compared to no training. N2pc and P3b amplitudes increased after training, reflecting attentional allocation and capacity enhancement, consistent with previous studies demonstrating behavioral improvements in selective attention following SOP training. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Changes in ERPs related to attention allocation and capacity following SOP training support the idea that training leads to cognitive enhancement. Specifically, we provide electrophysiological evidence that SOP training may be successful in counteracting age-related declines in selective attention. <ovid:br/>Significance: This study provides important evidence of the underlying mechanisms by which SOP training improves cognitive function in older adults. &#xa9; 2013.

N2  - Objective This study examines the short-term and long-term effects of a cognitive training (CT) program in enhancing cognitive function of older people with subjective memory complaints. Methods A single-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was carried out in a sample of 223 older adults aged 65 years or above with subjective memory complaints in Hong Kong. They were randomly assigned to either receive CT (intervention group, N = 111) or attend health-related educational lectures only (control group, N = 112). Participants' cognitive abilities were assessed by the Chinese version of Mattis Dementia Rating Scale at baseline, immediately after the training, and nine months after the training. Results Significant interaction effect of CT and education was detected on participants' CT gains at both T2 (F(2, 200) = 6.329, p = 0.002, eta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.060) and T3 (F(2, 189) = 3.294, p = 0.039, eta<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.034). Conclusions Cognitive training was effective in enhancing the overall cognitive functioning of less educated older adults with subjective memory complaints. The positive effect was durable for at least nine months in two cognitive areas, namely conceptualization and memory. Copyright &#xa9; 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To examine the synergistic effects of both computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CACR) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive function in patients with stroke. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The current double-blind, sham-controlled study enrolled a total of 11 patients who were newly diagnosed with stroke. The patients of the tDCS group (n=6) completed sessions of the Korean computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation program five times a week for 30 minutes a session during a mean period of 18.5 days concomitantly with the anodal tDCS over the bilateral prefrontal cortex combined with the CACR. The patients of the control group (n=5) also completed sessions of the sham stimulation during a mean period of 17.8 days. Anodal tDCS over bilateral prefrontal cortex (F3 and F4 in 10-20 EEG system) was delivered for 30 minutes at an intensity of 2 mA. Cathode electrodes were applied to the non-dominant arm. All the patients were evaluated using the Seoul Computerized Neuropsychological Test (SCNT) and the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Mann-Whitney U test revealed a significant difference between the two groups. The patients of the tDCS group achieved a significant improvement in the post/pre ratio of auditory continuous performance test and visual continuous performance test on the SCNT items. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that the concomitant use of the tDCS with CACR to the prefrontal cortex may provide additional beneficial effects in improving the cognitive dysfunction for patients with stroke. &#xa9; 2014 The Korean Neurosurgical Society.

N2  - Background: Improving the situation in older adults with cognitive decline and evidence of cognitive rehabilitation is considered crucial in long-term care of the elderly. The objective of this study was to implement a computerized errorless learning-based memory training program (CELP) for persons with early Alzheimer's disease, and to compare the training outcomes of a CELP group with those of a therapist-led errorless learning program (TELP) group and a waiting-list control group. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A randomized controlled trial with a single-blind research design was used in the study. Chinese patients with early Alzheimer's disease screened by the Clinical Dementia Rating (score of 1) were recruited. The subjects were randomly assigned to CELP (n = 6), TELP (n = 6), and waiting-list control (n = 7) groups. Evaluation of subjects before and after testing, and at three-month follow-up was achieved using primary outcomes on the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination, Chinese Dementia Rating Scale, Hong Kong List Learning Test, and the Brief Assessment of Prospective Memory-Short Form. Secondary outcomes were the Modified Barthel Index, Hong Kong Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form. The data were analyzed using Friedman's test for time effect and the Kruskal-Wallis test for treatment effect. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Positive treatment effects on cognition were found in two errorless learning-based memory groups (ie, computer-assisted and therapist-led). Remarkable changes were shown in cognitive function for subjects receiving CELP and emotional/daily functions in those receiving TELP. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Positive changes in the cognitive function of Chinese patients with early Alzheimer's disease were initially found after errorless training through CELP. Further enhancement of the training program is recommended. &#xa9; 2013 Lee et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

N2  - Background:Older adults with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus are at increased risk of falling. The current study aims to identify risk factors that mediate the relationship between diabetes and falls. <ovid:br/>Method(s):199 older adults (104 with diabetes and 95 healthy controls) underwent a medical screening. Gait (GAITRite), balance (AccuGait force plate), grip strength (Jamar), and cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination and Clock Drawing Test) were assessed. Falls were prospectively recorded during a 12-month follow-up period using monthly calendars. <ovid:br/>Result(s):Compared to controls, diabetes participants scored worse on all physical and cognitive measures. Sixty-four participants (42 diabetes vs. 22 controls) reported at least one injurious fall or two non-injurious falls ("fallers"). Univariate logistic regression identified diabetes as a risk factor for future falls (Odds Ratio 2.25, 95%CI 1.21-4.15, p = 0.010). Stepwise multiple regressions defined diabetes and poor balance as independent risk factors for falling. Taking more medications, slower walking speed, shorter stride length and poor cognitive performance were mediators that reduced the Odds Ratio of the relationship between diabetes and faller status relationship the most followed by reduced grip strength and increased stride length variability. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s):Diabetes is a major risk factor for falling, even after controlling for poor balance. Taking more medications, poorer walking performance and reduced cognitive functioning were mediators of the relationship between diabetes and falls. Tailored preventive programs including systematic medication reviews, specific balance exercises and cognitive training might be beneficial in reducing fall risk in older adults suffering from diabetes. &#xa9; 2013 Roman de Mettelinge et al.

N2  - Background: Post-stroke cognitive impairment is a major and heavy burden for patients and their caregivers. It has been reported in 7- 30% of survivors and thus occurs 2-5 times more frequent than stroke recurrence. No measures of prevention have up to now been effectively tested. The Austrian Polyintervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Decline After Ischemic Stroke (NCT01109836 ) tests the efficacy and safety of intensive, individualized and multifactorial interventions focused on risk factors and lifestyle to reduce the risk of cognitive decline in acute stroke patients. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Randomized, controlled, multicenter, observer-blind trial, includes 200 patients aged 40- 80 years with mild to moderate acute ischemic stroke (NIH stroke scale 1-14) applying multi-interventional intense control and motivation for medication, blood pressure control, healthy diet, physical activity and cognitive training. The reference group obtains stroke care according to standard guidelines. Primary outcomes are 1) the number of patients with a significant cognitive decline at 24 months 2) changes in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale at 24 months. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 200 patients were randomized 17 days (mean) after stroke. Mean age was 62 years and 29% were female. At inclusion NIHSS was low in both groups (mean: 1.9 +/- 1.9 and 1.6 +/- 1.8 in intervention versus control group, respectively) and cognitive impairment at inclusion was mild (mean Mini-Mental State Examination for intervention: 28.6 +/-0.2 and control: 28.8 +/- 0.3). Clinical, demographic and risk factor profile was comparable between groups. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study will provide evidence whether a multifactorial intervention including life style modification can reduce the risk of cognitive decline in patients with mild to moderate stroke.

N2  - Background: It was well known that cognitive training has been shown to improve cognitive abilities in older adults and patient with dementia but the effect of cognitive training and life style modification on every day to the dementia has not been demonstrated. <ovid:br/>Purpose(s): The purpose of this article was to know efficiency of utilization of the regional center for dementia to dementia and the effectiveness of multi-divisional-programming of the regional center for dementia to prevent cognitive decline in dementia Methods: Six hundred fifty six patients with dementia and mild cognitive impairment were recommended medical treatment and cognitive intervention programs through Seongdong-gu center for dementia. The Korean version of Mini-mental status examination (K-MMSE) and CERAD-K were done to evaluate cognitive improvement within12 months. Totally 52 patients were actively participated in cognitive intervention program. Comparison between active participants and pharmacotherapy treated only groups were done by using K-MMSE and CERAD-K. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There was significant cognitive improvement in the group of medical and cognitive intervention group in K-MMSE test through regional center for dementia (annual change of MMSE: 0.26). Frontal executive function and word memory recognition test were maintained and improved in active participants. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Active cognitive intervention and multi-divisional programs might affect the cognitive improvement to the progression of dementia. These results might reflect the effectiveness of a variety of the interventional program through the regional center for dementia to the prevention of the dementia.

N2  - Aim: Cognitive stimulation and rehabilitation, can reduce cognitive decline and also revert Mild Cognitive Impairment and delay dementia. Many factors indirectly influence the cognitive ability of the elderly, such as chronic diseases and lifestyle habits. It' s important to evaluate if tobacco exposure can affect the performance of cognitive stimulation and rehabilitation to develop new cognitive stimulation and rehabilitation methodologies. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To evaluate the influence of tobacco exposure in a program of cognitive stimulation and rehabilitation mediated by computers and internet. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Open cohort, controlled and non randomized (quasi experimental), study. Data collected between 2008 and 2012, in two cities of Santa Catarina (Tubaro and Palhoa). Information about chronic morbidities, sociodemographic profile, lifestyle (tobacco exposure), medications, functional status (initial and final), Mini-Mental Status Examination (initial and final) were collected among participants of a 12 week cognitive stimulation and rehabilitation program based in computers and internet use with participants aged 50 or older from the community with memory complaints, non demented. We studied clinical, sociodemographic profile and lifestyle variables. The outcome was the variation of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before and after cognitive rehabilitation in participants aged 50 years or older. Final model obtained by multivariate linear regression after univariate and bivariate analysis. This study was approved by Brazilian National Health Council (ethics in research). <ovid:br/>Result(s): 194 participants, female 166 (85.6%), age 64.67-6.85 years, 8.32-4.66 years of schooling, never smokers 134 (69.1%), former smokers 50 (25.7%), still smoking 10 (5.15%). Former smokers had 0.70-2.03 x never smokers 1.63-2.44 in MMSE variation (p=0.011). Initial MMSE (p=0.000) and years of study (p=0.025) were significant and independent variables in relation to a lower variation of the MMSE after cognitive rehabilitation, analysis controlled by age, years of schooling, marital status, social status, gender, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, dyslipidemia, stroke, myocardial infarct, peripheral arterial insufficiency, BMI, sedentarism, depression, number of continuous medications, use of benzodiazepinics, functional capacity and time between initial and final interview. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Former smokers had a worse performance compared to those who have never smoked in a cognitive stimulation and rehabilitation program, reinforcing the need for preventive education and basic health care' s prevention.

N2  - It is assumed that non pharmacological interventions can contribute to slow the progression of AD and improve patients' quality of life. Cognitive training and reminiscence therapy are among the most popular approaches focused on cognition. Cognitive training, one of the first established non-pharmacological interventions for dementia that focused on improvement of cognitive abilities, generally consists in a structured practice on a set of standard tasks designed to involve various cognitive functions. Although different, reminiscence therapy also has a cognitive rationale. With people with dementia often able to recall events from their youth or childhood, but not from earlier the same day, this approach offers the opportunity to tap into the apparently preserved store of remote memories. For both cognitive training and reminiscence therapies, interventions are typically conducted in a group to enhance social functioning. Although less frequently applied in day care centers probably because of its higher cost, cognitive rehabilitation, is being increasingly discussed in relation to dementia. Cognitive rehabilitation relies on an individualized approach where personally relevant goals are identified, and the therapist works with the patient and his caregiver to devise strategies to address these goals. In this strategy, the emphasis is put on improving performance in everyday life situations, rather than on cognitive performance. Efficacy of such interventions has often been discussed but rarely demonstrated. Two Cochrane reviews examining cognitive training have been published showing very little evidence of patients' improvement. Recently, the REMCARE study, the largest multicentre RCT on reminiscence therapy ever conducted showed no differences between the intervention and control conditions on quality of life, activities of daily living, mood, and service use and costs in patients, and increased anxiety in caregivers. Regarding individualized cognitive rehabilitation, to date, there is no RCT available. The ETNA3 study aims at assessing the impact of cognitive training, reminiscence therapy and an individualized cognitive rehabilitation program on the progression rate of alzheimer's disease (AD). ETNA3 is a French nationwide prospective simple-blind clinical trial on patients suffering AD randomized in four parallel groups. Patients were followed 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the initiation of the non-drug therapy. The study complied with the declaration of helsinki regarding investigation in humans and was approved by local ethics committees. Between april 2008 and December 2011, we enrolled 653 patients diagnosed with AD according to criteria of the NINCDSADRDA in 40 centers. Enrollment was restricted to patients aged 50 and over, in the mild to moderate stage of the disease (MMSE score between 16 to 26; Global Deterioration Scale score between 3 to 5), and non-institutionalized. Investigation centers were memory centers or geriatric day-care centers associated with a memory clinic. All the therapists were experienced psychologists or speech therapists in the field of AD management who received a specific training session of 4 days for the non pharmacological therapies tested. Each therapy program consisted in 90 minute-weekly sessions during the first 3 months. Then maintenance sessions were held every 6 weeks for the consecutive 21 months following a more flexible program. The cognitive training therapy consisted in a structured program of a set of standard tasks designed to involve various cognitive functions such as memory, attention, language or executive function. For reminiscence therapy, each session focused on a different theme such as schooldays, birthday, marriage, working life, holidays. For both therapies, groups involved 5 to 8 patients and sessions were arranged with the caregivers aiming at providing them information upon alzheimer's disease, symptoms, progression, and treatment was delivered by psychologists and medical staff. Finally, the individualized cognitive rehabilitation therapy consisted in a made-to-measure program supervised by a trained psychologist. The first two sessions were exclusively dedicated to define the goals of the training program with the person suffering dementia and his/her caregiver. The goals could consist of improving a particular meaningful activity of daily living, maintaining a leisure activity, or could consist in an individualized reminiscence-like program. Contrary to the other two groups, caregivers were not proposed to participate to group sessions, but regularly received a telephone contact. The control condition consisted in usual medical care without any non-pharmacological therapy applied to patients. Caregivers were offered the opportunity to participle to caregivers support groups sessions. The primary outcome was the survival without severe dementia at the 24-month follow-up. Severe dementia was measured according to current guidelines, i.e. A MMSE score lower than 10 or stages 5 to 6 of the GDS. The secondary outcomes included: delay of institutionalization, cognitive deterioration, behavioral symptoms, functional abilities, apathy, depressive symptoms, quality of life, caregiver's burden and socio-medical costs measured. Each outcome measure was assessed in each nonpharmacological group and will be compared to that observed in the control group. To date, the ETNA3 study is the largest RCT , assessing several cognitive-oriented approaches during a two-year period. The results should contribute to define recommendations in the management of patients and families.

N2  - Background: Executive dysfunction in geriatric depression is common, leads to poor clinical outcomes and often persists despite remission of mood symptoms. This leaves patients perpetually vulnerable to disability and relapse. Specific executive functions, (i.e. susceptibility to cognitive interference and strategic semantic organization) appear to predict remission with conventional antidepressants. Neurobiologically-informed computerized cognitive remediation (CCR) can reduce both age-related cognitive decline, and some cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. This emerging CCR methodology, along with our findings in executive function provides an opportunity for a novel intervention. We developed a CCR intervention to target and treat executive dysfunction (ED) in geriatric depression (CCR-GD). Our assumption is that remediation of ED may modulate the underlying brain network abnormalities shared by ED and depression. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The objective of this study was to compare CCRGD to a gold standard treatment (Lexapro: 20 mgs/12 weeks). We hypothesized that our targeted CCR treatment would improve both ED and depression in participants who had failed at least one trial of an adequate does of SNRI or SSRI. CCR-GD: Older adults (60-89) with major depression (by SCID-R/DSM-IV), who failed to achieve remission after treatment with therapeutic dosages of an SSRI or SNRI or at least 8 weeks. We also asked that they and their physicians had no plan to change medication or dosages for the duration of the study. 11 patients signed informed consent and entered the study (mean age=73.5 years; sd=7.8). 7 of 11 Patients were recruited after failing to remit during a controlled 12-week escitalopram trial from the ACISR. Of the 11 patients, 10 completed the four-week trial (91%). All 10 maintained the same medication and dosage throughout the trial. Participants underwent a neuropsychological battery at baseline and 4 weeks. Lexapro: Participants in CCR were matched to three elderly depressed historical control participants on three criteria: Age, depression severity, and executive dysfunction due to their demonstrable effect on clinical outcomes. All participants in both studies met DSM-IV-TR criteria for unipolar major depression and had a score 4 20 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Exclusion criteria: Major depression with psychotic features; other psychiatric disorders (except personality disorders); severe medical illness within the 3 months preceding the study; neurological disorders; medical conditions often associated with depression; drugs causing depression; MMSE score<25; or current psychotherapy. Treatment: CCR: Participants completed 30 h of cognitive remediation on their own at the ACISR. There was no psychologist or psychiatrist intervention. Research assistants unaware of the study's hypotheses collected clinical ratings weekly. Lexapro: After a 2-week drug wash-out and single blind placebo lead-in, participants who still met DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depression received controlled treatment with fixed-dose escitalopram 20 mg daily for 12 weeks. Statistical Analysis: We first compared the groups on 6 clinically relevant variables using Mann-Whitney U statistics. Then, to assess for the significance of an interaction between treatment group and time in the trial we completed a longitudinal mixed models analysis with a random intercept and time in study, group, and a time by group interaction as fixed effects. The outcome variable was total MADRS score. As CCR is designed to remediate executive dysfunction, we attempted to compare the change in executive test scores (Trails B, Stroop CW) over time (baseline, end of study) by group using two repeated measures ANOVAs. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There was no difference between the two groups in terms of baseline MADRS (U=180.0, p=0.967), age U=173; p=0.818), education (U=141.5; p=0.273), age of onset U=153; p=0.440, or executive function (measured by Trails B) (U=152; p=0.424). There was not a significant overall group effect, F(1,49.23)=0.019, p=0.892, indicating that the two groups did not differ in their final MADRS score. There was a significant time effect, F(1,71.22)=30.97, p<0.001. In addition, the group by time interaction was significant, F(1,61.8)=5.32, p=0.024 suggesting that the two groups did differ in the length of time it took to respond to their respective treatments. The CCR participants MADRS scores dropped an average of 16.5 points over 4 weeks, 8 weeks faster than the Lex group. For the comparison of ED over time by group, the data indicated that CCR improved Trails B performance more than Lexapro (t=2.28, DF=41, p=0.027); and that there was a trend for the Stroop Color- Word (t=1.86, DF=41, p=0.103). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Deficits in executive function do not appear to change even after an effective course of medication, which leaves patients vulnerable to relapse. Though the data are preliminary, CCR-GD appears improve affective symptoms more quickly than Lexapro in patients who have previously failed to respond. In addition, CCR may improve both targeted and non-targeted executive functions while Lexapro does not.

Evidence shows cognitive impairment is preventable by cognitive stimulation. "Remembrance Workshop" is a cognitive stimulation and rehabilitation program based on computers and internet use. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The objective of this study is to determine whether a cognitive stimulation and rehabilitation program based in computers and internet use can prevent cognitive impairmentmeasured byMMSE. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Intervention controlled cohort study, quasi experimental, was approved by Brazilian National Health Council. All participants were 50 or older, had memory complaints and had normal MMSE >= 25. Analysis was performed by logistic regression after univariate and bivariate analyses, p < 0.05. Outcome was MMSE < 25 after the second interview. Intervention group had program plus medical follow-up and control group had only medical follow-up. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): 20 biweekly workshops, 1.5 h each. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Intervention group 112, 99 (88.4%) remained having no cognitive impairment and 13 (11.6%) showed having cognitive worsening. Control group, 96, 70 (72.9%) had no cognitive impairment and 26 (27.1%) had cognitiveworsening. Control variables: gender, age, education, marital status, social status, physical activity, obesity, depression, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypothyroidism, polypharmacy, dyslipidemia, smoking, use of benzodiazepines, diabetes, functional capacity, time between the first and second interviews, and initial MMSE. Hypertension was significant only in the bivariate analysis (p=0.031, RR=2.18 95% CI 1.02 to 4.65). Intervention was the only significant variable with an independent protective factor of 0.42 (95% CI 0.35-0.90, p < 0.029), NNT=6.5. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The intervention was associated with prevention of cognitive impairment.

N2  - Background: The Sound Training for Attention and Memory in Dementia (STAM-Dem) is a manualized music-based protocol designed to be used in the rehabilitation of cognitive functions in elderly patients with dementia (PWD). <ovid:br/>Method(s): This was a multicenter, single-blind, randomized, and controlled trial that involved 51 PWD. The objective was to test the STAM-Dem efficacy. Patients in the experimental group followed the STAM-Dem for 2 weekly sessions of 45 minutes for 12 weeks (in addition to standard care). Those in the control group continued with the normal standard care provided. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In the experimental group, the instruments immediate prose memory test (MPI), deferred prose memory test (MPD), attentional matrices, activities of daily living, Music Therapy Activity Scale (SVAM) and Geriatric Music Therapy Profile (GMP) increase significantly from pre to post-test (P < .05). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The protocol is feasible and data suggest that there was an effect on attentino (matrices) and prose memory skills (MPI and MPD). The effect size reveals a general improvement in the results of the experimental group. &#xa9; The Author(s) 2012.

T1  - Online Games Training Aging Brains: Limited transfer to cognitive control functions

N2  - The prevalence of age-related cognitive decline will increase due to graying of the global population. The goal of the present study was to test whether playing online cognitive training games can improve cognitive control (CC) in healthy older adults. Fifty-four older adults (age 60-77) played five different cognitive training games online for 30 min a day over a period of seven weeks (game group). Another group of 20 older adults (age 61-73) instead answered quiz questions about documentaries online (documentary group). Transfer was assessed by means of a cognitive test battery administered before and after the intervention. The test battery included measures of working memory updating, set shifting, response inhibition, attention, and inductive reasoning. Compared with the documentary group, the game group showed larger improvement of inhibition (Stop-Signal task) and inductive reasoning (Raven-SPM), whereas the documentary group showed more improvement in selective attention (UFoV-3). These effects qualify as transfer effects, because response inhibition, inductive reasoning and selective attention were not targeted by the interventions. However, because seven other indicators of CC did not show benefits of game training and some of those that did suffered from potential baseline differences, the study as a whole provides only modest support for the potential of videogame training to improve CC in healthy older adults. &#xa9; 2012 van Muijden, Band and Hommel.

N2  - Background. Episodic memory and semantic abilities deteriorate early in Alzheimer disease (AD). Since the cognitive system includes interconnected and reciprocally influenced neuronal networks, the authors hypothesized that stimulation of lexical-semantic abilities may benefit semantically structured episodic memory. Objective. To investigate the effects of lexical-semantic stimulation (LSS) on verbal communication and episodic memory in early AD. Methods. Forty AD participants were randomized to LSS or unstructured cognitive stimulation (UCS) as control condition. Treatments lasted 3 months, 2 sections a week. The primary outcome measures were the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Verbal Naming Test (VNT), Phonemic and Semantic Fluency, Story Recall, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning (RAVL). Secondary outcome measures were neuropsychological tests assessing cognitive functions not stimulated by the intervention, such as attention, executive functions, and visual-spatial abilities, and the instrumental activities of daily living scale. A 6-month follow-up assessment was administered to the LSS group. Results. LSS treatment yielded significant improvements of the MMSE, BNT, VNT, Brief Story Recall, and RAVL delayed recall mean scores. Among secondary outcome measures, only working memory and the speed of a task assessing executive functions (Stroop test) improved after LSS. Unstructured cognitive stimulation intervention did not improve any cognitive domain. Six months after LSS discontinuation, the MMSE mean score remains significantly higher than the baseline value. Conclusion. LSS treatment may improve episodic memory in AD patients and may be regarded as a clinical option to counteract the cognitive decline typical of the disease. &#xa9; 2012 The Author(s).

N2  - Considering the high risk for individuals with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (A-MCI) to progress towards Alzheimer's disease (AD), we investigated the efficacy of a non-pharmacological intervention, that is, cognitive training that could reduce cognitive difficulties and delay the cognitive decline. For this, we evaluated the efficacy of a 12-week computer-based memory-attention training program based on recognition in subjects with A-MCI and compared their performances with those of A-MCI controls trained in cognitively stimulating activities. The effect of training was assessed by comparing outcome measures in pre- and post-tests 15 days before and after training. To evaluate the duration of training benefits, a follow-up test session was performed 6 months after memory and attention training or cognitively stimulating activities.Outcome measures showed that the trained group, compared to control group, improved episodic recall and recognition. Six months after training, scores remained at the level of the post-test.Since the training program was exclusively based on recognition, our results showed a generalization from recognition to recall processes, which are memory components that represent part of the core cognitive impairments in individuals at risk of converting to AD. Thus, cognitive training based on recognition holds promise as a preventive therapeutic method and could be proposed as a non-pharmacological early-intervention strategy. Future investigations need to focus on methodological constraints and delineating possible neuroplastic mechanisms of action. &#xa9; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of our investigation was to identify cognitive function using a computerized neuropsychological test and its effects on daily activity functional outcomes in patients with brain tumors. <ovid:br/>Method(s): From April 2008 to December 2009, 29 brain tumor patients (12 men and 17 women, average age=45.0+/-16.8 years) were enrolled. All patients were screened for their cognitive function using the Korean-Mini-Mental Status Exam (K-MMSE) and were assessed using a computerized neuropsychological test (CNT). The motricity index, K-MMSE, and K-MBI were performed at the beginning and at the end of admission. All patients underwent conventional rehabilitation therapy for 4 weeks; if the score of K-MMSE was <24 (defined as the cognitive dysfunction), cognitive training was performed. <ovid:br/>Result(s): All variables in the computerized neuropsychiatric test in all patients with brain tumor show cognitive dysfunction compared with normal adults. All patients significantly improved after rehabilitation treatment for 4 weeks. The final K-MBI scores correlated significantly with the initial K-MBI, word block, backward visual span, and trail making test A (R<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup>00.875, p<0.01). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): We suggest that the objective evaluation of cognitive function and focused cognitive training, as well as conventional rehabilitation, should be performed in brain tumor patients.

N2  - Backgrounds: Previous studies about cognitive intervention targeting older adults revealed that cognitive training had effects on the improvement of cognitive function. However, there have been few studies that investigat direct changes of brain structures after cognitive training. The advanced scientific technique allowed us to develop service robots designed to assist human work, which can be important with an increase in the aging population and high costs of elderly care. In this regard, we considered robots for elderly's cognitive training and developed 17 cognitive programs in collaboration with Center for Intelligent Robotics at Korea Institute of Science and Technology. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the effects of our newly developed robotic cognitive training programs on the brain structures in older adults without dementia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This study was a randomized, controlled single blind trial. Eighty-five volunteers aged 60 years or older were recruited from a single community center in Seoul, Korea. All of them were screened using Mini-Menal State Examination (MMSE) and those with scores lower than 26 were excluded. Persons were also excluded from participation if they had known dementia or significant cognitive impairment accompanied by dysfunction of daily living activities. Participants were given baseline assessments and randomly assigned to 3 groups; 24 with robot assisted cognitive training (Robot group), 24 with experienced behavioral therapist (Conventional group), and 37 without cognitive training (Control group).The cognitive training consisted of 60 sessions which organized daily 90 minutes,5 days per week for 12 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention assessment included brain MRI, neuropsychological tests, and questionnaires about life style. The primary outcome of this study was the change in cortical thickness between the baseline and the post-intervention assessment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were no statistical differences between 3 groups in terms of age, sex, years of education and the baseline scores of MMSE. The risk factors for dementia including frequency of ApoE 4 allele, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia between 3 groups were not different either. One participant in the robot intervention group and 2 persons in the control group dropped out from the study because they withdrew the consent during the study. The primary reason for withdrawing was time commitment to training and assessment. All 47 participants in the intervention groups attended 51 and more (> 85%) out of 60 sessions. The robot group showed a tendency that the mean cortical thickness increased by 0.012 mm during 12 weeks while decreased in the conventional and control group during the same period. But there was no statistical significant time-by group interaction (p=0.163). The topographical analysis showed that compared to control group, the conventional group showed significant lesser cortical thinning in the left medial prefrontal and several areas on the right middle temporal gyrus. Compared to controls, the robot group also demonstrated lesser cortical thinning in the bilateral medial frontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal cortex and right parahippocampal , primary motor and sensory cortices. When conventional and robot groups were directly compared, the robot group revealed attenuated cortical thinning, particularly on bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortices (ACC). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Lesser cortical thinning found in two intervention groups compared to control group can suggest that cognitive training is helpful to mitigate against decreasing cortical thickness. Especially in the present study, the robot assisted cognitive training program would bring about a favorable effect over the conventional behavioral therapy on bilateral prefrontal areas including ACC that are well known for executive attention, error detection and conflict monitoring.

N2  - Background: Cognitive stimulation (CS) is a non-pharmacological intervention able to prevent or delay cognitive decline in elderly subjects. Recently, a meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials provided consistent evidence that CS benefit cognition in people with mild to moderate dementia (Woods, 2012; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Issue 2). More research is needed to find out whether contributing factors could exist to predict change in the outcome of CS. For example, little is known about the genetic characteristics of people who are more likely to benefit from CS. The aim of this presentation is to investigate with a randomized controlled trial whether 1) CS improve cognitive performance measured by MOntreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) in non-demented elderly subjects at risk to develop dementia, 2) there could be any difference in the response to CS between subjects with and without cognitive decline, 3) the main genetic risk factor for dementia, APOE Epsilon 4 allele, may impact on the efficacy of CS intervention. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This work was a part of ALLENA-MENTE randomized open label controlled trial conducted to evaluate the long-term efficacy (4 years) of cognitive stimulation (CS, intervention group) with respect to sanitary education treatment (SE, "active" control group) on cognitive level measured by MMSE. Both groups were compound by two subsamples: mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and non-MCI with familiarity for dementia (NDFAM). Participants were recruited from the "InveCe.Ab" study, a longitudinal assessment of cognitive function in people born between'935-39 and resident in Abbiategrasso. 16 MCI subjects in each arm were enough to detect a difference of 2 points in MMSE between CS and SE group with a statistical power of 80% and two-sided alpha of 0.05. 20 patients were enrolled in each study group to compensate a drop-out rate of 20% in the follow-up period. Similarly, 36 NDFAM people needed to detect a difference of 1 point in MMSE among CS and SE with an increasing of 10% to take into account the drop-out. A randomization stratified by birth year and schooling (1:1) between groups was made. CS consisted in a 10- session of cognitive stimulation made by trained operators (2-hours over 5 weeks): language stimulation, abstract reasoning, executive functioning, memory. SE was made of two sanitary education lessons. MOCA test administered pre and post-treatment was used to measure cognitive performance. A blood sample was collected from each participant for genomic DNA extraction and ApoE genotyping (Real Time PCR Assay). Variation in MOCA test between baseline and the end of treatment were analyzed using paired t test, while the efficacy of CS stimulation with respect to ES was investigated by unpaired t test. A multivariate linear regression analysis was applied to adjust the efficacy of CS on final MOCA score for confounders (sex, schooling, APOE genotype). Baseline MOCA score and a variable identifying 2 subsamples were among covariates. The interaction between APOE and treatment was also tested. Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS11. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Pavia (Italy). <ovid:br/>Result(s): 121 people participated to the trial: 44 MCI and 77 NDFAM. The subjects enrolled in the CS group were 61 (23 MCI and 38 NDFAM) and 60 (21 MCI and 39 NDFAM) in the ES one. A significant improvement in cognitive performance within CS (baseline: 21.8 end: 23.7; t=-6.5; p< 0.0001) and ES interventions (baseline: 21.8 end: 22.9; t=-3.6; p=0.0007) was found. Anyway, the gain in MOCA score was significantly higher in the CS group than in the SE group (CS: 1.89 +/- 2.26, SE : 1.05 +/- 2.27; t=2.0, p= 0.045). The efficacy of CS intervention was still statistically significant after adjustment for confounders (p= 0.045). At baseline, MCI subsample showed a lower MOCA score than NDFAM (19.30 +/- 3.12 vs 23.22 +/- 3.54; t=-6.4; p= 0.001). MOCA score significantly improved in CS with respect to SE only in the NDFAM subsample (NDFAM-CS: 2.39 +/- 2.34, SE : 0.9 +/- 2.57; t=2.67; p= 0.009; MCI- CS: 1.04 +/- 1.87, SE : 1.33 +/- 1.59; t=-0.55; p= 0.585). APOE genotype was significantly associated to the final MOCA score (p= 0.013), but the interaction term was not relevant (p=0.19). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The findings indicate that cognitive stimulation benefits cognition in elderly non-demented subjects. Moreover, few sessions of CS are potentially more beneficial for subjects without cognitive deficits (NDFAM) rather than in MCI at short term. Follow-up evaluations are necessary to assess the long-term effect of this kind of intervention and potentially to highlight a benefit also for MCI subjects in terms of a slower cognitive decline over time. APOE genotype does not modify the efficacy of CS compared to SE, even if it impacts on the gain in MOCA score.

N2  - Prevention strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are urgently needed due to its high and rising prevalence. Because of the multifactorial nature of AD, it now seems pertinent to propose a << multi-domain >> intervention, combining interventions that target several physio-pathological pathways leading to the onset of the disease, in order to examine their potential synergistic action in reducing the risk. The Multidomain Alzheimer disease Preventive Trial (MAPT) is a three-year prospective study of frail older adults randomized to treatment (omega-3 and /or multi-domain intervention) or placebo. The proposed multidomain intervention consists of collective training sessions in the following three areas: nutrition, physical activity, cognitive training and preventive consultations (to control risk factors). The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of treatment with omega-3 and/or multi-domain intervention on slopes of cognitive decline. The main outcome measure is the change in cognitive function at 3 years determined by the Grober and Buschke Test (a memory-recall test of 16 words). MAPT is a multicentre, randomized, placebo controlled study, using a 4-group design including 3 treatment groups (omega 3 alone, multi-domain intervention alone, omega 3 plus multi-domain intervention at n=420 each) and a placebo group (n=420). Visits are scheduled every 6 months to assess physical condition, diseases and corresponding treatments, adherence to and tolerance of omega 3 treatment, adherence to multi-domain intervention, and to deliver the supplement. Cognitive and functional assessments are conducted at baseline, six months, and annually at 1, 2 and 3 years by independent research staff blinded to intervention. All the assessments are performed by hospital practitioner memory experts. The protocol is registered on a public- access clinical trial database (www.clinicaltrials.gov). In addition, three neuroimaging ancillary studies were proposed to MAPT participants: (i) the MRI-MAPT study will explore the effects of interventions on cerebral atrophy (total brain and hippocampal volumes); (ii) the FDG-Pet study will explore the effects of multidomain intervention on cerebral metabolism (only in Toulouse center) and (iii) the AV45-PET study will evaluate brain amyloid deposits. The recruitment goal for the MAPT trial was to enrol 1680 frail elderly people, aged 70 years and over, living independently in good functional and cognitive status. Definition of frailty is to date not consensual but we used three clinical components to identify frail persons based on epidemiological evidence: memory complaint, to their primary care physician, limitation in one instrumental activity of daily living (ability to use the telephone, shop, prepare meals, do housekeeping, do one's laundry, use transportation, follow a medication schedule and manage money) (IADL) and slow walking speed (speed lower than 0.8 m/s which means more than 5 seconds to walk 4 meters). Participants were excluded from the study when presenting dementia (DSMIV criteria), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score lower than 24 over 30, subjects who had incapacities for basic activities of daily living (ADL score lower than 6 over6), and those who were severely depressed (Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score over 15) and, other disorders that could interfere with the interpretation of the study (like visual or hearing impairments). The inclusion period lasted 33 months. Recruitment in neuroimaging ancillary studies MRI-MAPT ancillary study: The MRI-MAPT study was conducted in the 7 University Hospital centers (Toulouse, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Limoges, Dijon, Lyon and Nice) and 2 General Hospitals (Foix, Tarbes). The first inclusion was on January 8, 2010, and the targeted number of 500 participants was reached on August 3', 2011.Currently, 504 participants have undergone baseline MRI. A final MRI at the end of the study (3 years) will be performed.FDG-PET ancillary study: The first inclusion was on June 8, 2009, and the targeted number of 68 participants was reached on February 9, 2011. 40. All FDG-PET scans were performed at baseline and at 6 months. A final FDG-PET scan at the end of the first year of the study will be performed.AV45-PET ancillary study: The first inclusion was on July 12, 2010, and the enrolment is still in progress. At this time, 220 PET-scans were performed during the two first years of the study. Numerous epidemiological studies to prevent cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease have shown that nutrition, physical exercise, cognitive stimulation and social activities play a significant role in maintaining cognitive function. There are currently a number of epidemiological evidence for a protective role of each of these factors alone. In the United States and France, intervention studies called "multidomain" are being set up to evaluate long-term impact of such intervention in elderly patients to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, there are now data on the impact of a short multidomain intervention on brain metabolism measured by PET scan. This method could become an objective evaluation of such intervention. The study presented here is an ancillary study of the study MAPT (Multi-domain Alzheimer Disease Prevention Trail). The MAPT study is a Phase III study whose main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of supplementation in omega-3 intervention or a "multidomain" intervention (nutrition, exercise, cognitive stimulation , social activities), or their association on the evolution of cognitive function in frail elderly people aged 70 and older. Main objective: The main objective of this ancillary study was to assess the impact of an intervention program that includes a multidomain cognitive stimulation, physical exercise, nutrition education and social activities on brain metabolism in FDG PET to assess the effectiveness of such intervention on neuroimaging. Study population: The study presented here focuses on 68 of the 1680 MAPT-study participants. Thirty-four subjects in the intervention group will carry out the program multidomain and 34 subjects not realize the program. Methodology and results: These 68 subjects will be evaluated as provided in the MAPT study that will support the clinical evaluation, biological monitoring (three years in the study MAPT clinical evaluation, neuropsychological, biological every 6 months). These 68 subjects performing for this ancillary study an FDG PET scan at baseline, 6 months and 1 year and a MRI at inclusion and 1 year comprising (T1- 3D, T2-3D, Flair, DTI, T2*). The criteria for inclusion are those of the study MAPT and exclusion criteria will resume with the study MAPT plus those related to the implementation of an MRI and a PET scan. The characteristics of this population are Age (mean, SD) 76.97 (4.25), MMSE (mean, SD) 28.17 (1.61), CDR 0: 65.7% (n=44) CDR 0.5 34.3% (n=23), Prefrail 41.8% (n=28) and frail 3% (n=2). We demonstrate changes in brain metabolism in patients undergoing the multidomain program at baseline vs 6 months (Z score : 6.41-7.48 ; FWE 0.01/100 in prefontal region) and at baseline vs 12 months (Z score : 6.62-7.56 ; FWE 0.01/100 in prefontal region). This could be an as sessment of the effectiveness of such intervention on neuroimaging. Moreover, the data of the PET scans and other imaging like morphological brain imaging (MRI) could explain response or no response to stimulation program (presence of cerebral vascular lesions, brain atrophy, for example). The identification of early markers of effectiveness of such intervention seems relevant to early target individuals who can best benefit from the impact of this type of prevention program of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): Florbetapir is a F18-labeled amyloid-binding ligand that has recently been introduced as a PET agent for amyloid imaging in the brain of patients presenting Alzheimer Disease (AD). Furthermore a relationship has been established between the existence of frailty and AD occurrence has been demonstrated (Buchman and al. 2008), but in vivo amyloid neuroimaging by Florbetapir-PET in frailty patients has not been documented yet. This prospective study was conducted, to evaluate the presence and beta-amyloid density in elderly frail volunteers who don't meet the criteria of dementia or AD (DSM IV criteria). <ovid:br/>Method(s): The Florbetapir ancillary study is based on the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) survey.

N2  - Background: Dementia is one of the most troubling neurodegenerative syndrome whose prevalence and incidence is dramatically increasing. The current lack of effective treatments provides a strong incentive for an improved therapeutic strategy. Epidemiological studies have proved the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions (such as a healthy diet, cognitive stimulation, physical exercise) in preventing or delaying cognitive impairment in non-demented elderly subjects, but little is known about the influence of APOE genotype on these treatments. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation in non-demented elderly subjects in relation to APOE genotype. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Invece.Ab is a longitudinal multidimensional population study on brain aging (NCT01345110; http:// clinicaltrials.gov) in 1321 subjects living in Abbiategrasso (Milan, Italy) and born between 1935 and 1939.Within this population, 77 non-demented cognitively healthy subjects with familiarity for sporadic dementia (NDFAM) and 54 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were enrolled to test the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation. They were separately randomly assigned to a "treatment" (ten sessions of light physical activity and exercises for cognitive functions) and a "control" (two sanitary education lessons) group. MMSE, MOCA test and CORSI test were administered before and after the interventions by a blind trained psychologist. A blood sample was taken for APOE genotyping by Real-Time Allelic Discrimination assay. <ovid:br/>Result(s): NDFAMand MCI benefited from both cognitive stimulation and sanitary education. NDFAM registered a better improvement of performance in the neuropsychological tests after cognitive stimulation than MCI subjects and only for NDFAM, the improvement after the intervention was significantly different between the treatment and the control group. Furthermore subjects carrying at least an APOE- 3 4 allele, a risk factor for dementia, were less likely to benefit from the cognitive stimulation protocol adopted. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The participation to cognitive stimulation sessions or to sanitary education lessons improved cognitive performance in non-demented subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment. Anyway, only cognitively healthy subjects got a higher benefit from participating to the cognitive stimulation sessions rather than to sanitary education lessons. Furthermore, the extent of the benefit arisen from cognitive stimulation was related to the presence of the risk factor APOE- 34.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this paper was:- to analyse the behaviour of Working (WM) and Procedural (PM) Memory before a Rehabilitation Motor program (RM) in Parkinson Disease(PD) in agreement with the knowledge that WM and PM are important for the correct movement execution and that they are frequently compromised in PD(Goebe l,Neuropsychologia,2009); -to verify if a computerized-procedural-cognitive CPRC-training is able to show a positive effect on RM. <ovid:br/>Method(s): PD-subjects, (stage l-IV-Hoehn-Yhar-rating-scale), Minimental-State-Examinatin(MMSE)>24/30, Geriatric-Depression Scale(GDS)<5 underwent at baseline(B) to ActivityDaily-Linving(ADL) for functional status, Attentional-computerized-battery-www.psytest. net(WM-TAP) for WM and basal reaction times (BRT-MIDA) for PM. Extrapyramidal symptoms were rated using UPDRS (Unified-Parkinsin's-Disease-Rating-Scale) at B and at the end(E) of a 10-session-RM. Randomly selected subjects (SG) were successively admitted to CPRC-training at complex reaction times(CRT) and plan-a-day-CogRehab-set(PCR) before the RM. SG and control subjects(CS) underwent 1-hour standardized stretching-balance-postural exercises 3 times/week. Parametric and non parametric tests for quantitative data and chi-square for qualitative data were carried out. <ovid:br/>Result(s):6-SG an 5-CS did not differ for age(70,67+/-4,18;69,83+/-12,80), sex(m/f=4/2;3/2), MMSE(26,37+/-2,38;26,07+/-3,34), ADL(4,67+/-2,34;4,33+/-1,75) and UPDRS(47,17+/-17,15;47,33+/-16,78) at B. BRT-MIDAandWM-TAP response-times were slower than standardized population in SG:BRT(range:303^555msec),WM(range:493^1064) and CS:BRT(range: 28U507msec), WM(range:544+1058msec) with errors and omissions in WM-TAP. Repeated measures ANOVA and chi-square PCR-errors analysis didn't suggest CRTime and errors reduction respectively after training . UPDRS motor section(lll) demonstrated a positive CG trend (UPDRS-lll-median 23,00->22,00;p=0,055). No otherdifferenceswereencountered. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): PD rehabilitation is always motor (RM) and rarely cognitive(RC). The possibility to stress the PM via CPRC before a RM should be considered.

N2  - Objectives To determine the efficacy of multimodal, nondrug therapy on symptoms of dementia and need for care in institutionalized individuals with degenerative dementia. Design Randomized, controlled, longitudinal trial. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Setting Five German nursing homes. Participants One hundred thirty-nine nursing home residents with primary degenerative dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination score < 24). Intervention The 6-month intervention comprised three components: motor stimulation, activities of daily living, and cognitive stimulation (MAKS). Groups of 10 patients led by two therapists participated in the standardized intervention for 2 hours, 6 days a week. The intervention was described in detail in an intervention manual. Adherence to the manual was high. Controls received treatment as usual. Measurements Overall geriatric symptoms were recorded using the Nurses' Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients, functional independence using the Barthel Index, and care time using the Resource Utilization in Dementia-Formal Care. Results Of 646 individuals screened, 146 were eligible, and 130 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At 6 months, results of the per-protocol analysis (n = 119) showed improvement in overall dementia symptoms in the MAKS group and no change in the control group (adjusted mean difference (AMD) = -6.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -10.3 to -3.3; P <.001, Cohen d = 0.66). This effect was greatest on the social behavior (AMD = -1.9, 95% CI = -2.9 to -0.8; P <.001; Cohen d = 0.54) and instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) (AMD = -1.4, 95% CI = -2.5 to -0.30; P =.01; Cohen d = 0.43) subscales. No effect was seen on functional independence or total care time. Conclusion This 6-month nondrug multimodal intervention improved dementia symptoms in nursing home residents, especially in social behavior and IADL capabilities.

N2  - The effect of cognitive intervention on brain metabolism in AD is largely unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to investigate cognitive parameters and <ovid:sup>18</ovid:sup>FDG PET to test for effects of a cognitive intervention in patients with aMCI or mild AD. Patients with aMCI (N = 24) or mild AD (N = 15) were randomly assigned either to cognitive intervention groups (IGs), receiving weekly sessions of group-based multicomponent cognitive intervention, or active control groups (CGs), receiving pencil-paper exercises for self-study. We obtained resting-state FDG-PET scans and neuropsychological testing at baseline and after six-months. Normalized FDG-PET images were analyzed using voxel-based SPM5 approaches to determine longitudinal changes, group-by-time interactions and correlations with neuropsychological outcome parameters. Primary global cognitive outcome was determined by analyses of covariance with MMSE and ADAS-cog scores as dependent measures. Both, aMCI and AD subgroups of CGs showed widespread bilateral cortical declines in FDG uptake, while the AD subgroup of IGs showed discrete decline or rather no decline in case of the aMCI subgroup. Group by time analyses revealed strongest attenuation of metabolic decline in the aMCI subgroup of the IGs, involving left anterior temporal pole and anterior cingulate gyrus. However, correlation analyses revealed only weak non-significant associations between increased FDG uptake and improvement in primary or secondary outcome parameters. Concurrently, there was significant improvement in global cognitive status in the aMCI subgroup of the IGs. A six-month cognitive intervention imparted cognitive benefits in patients with aMCI, which were concurrent with an attenuated decline of glucose metabolism in cortical regions affected by neurodegenerative AD. &#xa9; 2011 IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Recent studies have shown that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its possible prodromal stage mild cognitive impairment benefit from cognitive interventions. Few studies so far have used an active control condition and determined effects in different stages of disease. We evaluated a newly developed 6-month group-based multicomponent cognitive intervention in a randomized controlled pilot study on subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and mild AD patients. Forty-three subjects with aMCI and mild AD were recruited. Primary outcome measures were change in global cognitive function as determined by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE). Secondary outcomes were specific cognitive and psychopathological ratings. Thirty-nine patients were randomized to intervention groups (IGs: 12 aMCI, 8 AD) and active control groups (CGs: 12 aMCI, 7 AD). At the end of the study, we found significant improvements in the IG<ovid:sup>MCI</ovid:sup> compared to the CG <ovid:sup>MCI</ovid:sup> in the ADAS-cog (p = 0.02) and for the secondary endpoint Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (p < 0.01) Effects on the MMSE score showed a non-significant trend (p = 0.07). In AD patients, we found no significant effect of intervention on the primary outcome measures. In conclusion, these results suggest that participation in a 6-month cognitive intervention can improve cognitive and non-cognitive functions in aMCI subjects. In contrast, AD patients showed no significant benefit from intervention. The findings in this small sample support the use of the intervention in larger scales studies with an extended follow-up period to determine long-term effects. &#xa9; 2011-IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - The effect of cognitive intervention on brain metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is largely unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to investigate clinical cognitive parameters and <ovid:sup>18</ovid:sup>FDG PET to test for effects of a cognitive intervention in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or mild AD. Patients with aMCI (n = 24) or mild AD (n = 15) were randomly assigned either to cognitive intervention groups (IGs), receiving weekly sessions of group-based multicomponent cognitive intervention, or active control groups (CGs), receiving pencil-paper exercises for self-study. We obtained resting-state FDG-PET scans and neuropsychological testing at baseline and after six-months. Normalized FDG-PET images were analyzed using voxel-based SPM5 approaches to determine longitudinal changes, group-by-time interactions, and correlations with neuropsychological outcome parameters. Primary global cognitive outcome was determined by analyses of covariance with MMSE and ADAS-cog scores as dependent measures. Both, aMCI and AD subgroups of CGs showed widespread bilateral cortical declines in FDG uptake, while the AD subgroup of IGs showed discrete decline or rather no decline in case of the aMCI subgroup. Group by time analyses revealed strongest attenuation of metabolic decline in the aMCI subgroup of the IGs, involving left superior temporal-and anterior cingulate gyrus. However, correlation analyses revealed only weak non-significant associations between increased FDG uptake and improvement in primary or secondary outcome parameters. Concurrently, there was significant improvement in global cognitive status in the aMCI subgroup of the IGs. A six-month cognitive intervention imparted cognitive benefits in patients with aMCI, which were concurrent with an attenuated decline of glucose metabolism in cortical regions affected by neurodegenerative AD. &#xa9; 2011-IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is regarded as a risk factor for later dementia. However, to date there is no approved pharmacological intervention.We randomized 40 subjects withMCI into two groups, one received a 12-week combinedmotor-cognitive training, the other one served as control group and received training later. Another control group comprised healthy elderly. The study was completed by 19 subjects in the MCI training group (age 65.8 +/- 4.9 years, 7 females, MMSE 27.2 +/- 1.2) and 19 subjects in the MCI control group (age 65.5 +/- 5.4 years, 9 females, MMSE 27.8 +/- 0.8). The healthy control group included 7 subjects (age 66.3 +/- 5.6 years, 3 females, MMSE 29.6 +/- 0.8). Compared to the healthy control group the MCI training group was impaired in the MMSE (p < .001), verbal working memory (p = .047) and verbal (p = .033) and figural (p = .033) episodic memory. After training, the MCI intervention group showed significantly improved measures in verbal episodic memory (p = .001), figural episodic immediate (p = .002) and delayed recall (p = .003) and alertness (p = .026). Compared to the MCI control group improvements were significant for verbal episodic memory (p = .041), visual episodic memory (p = .017) and alertness (p = .002). BDNF and imaging data are currently analyzed and will be presented at the meeting.

N2  - Background: To evaluate the effects of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program on cognitive, quality of life and depression symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). <ovid:br/>Method(s): Patients with MCI and mild to moderate AD were recruited at a university-based memory clinic. Eligible patients (n = 76 total, AD = 62 MCI = 14) were assigned to a 12-week stimulation program, which was provided by a multiprofessional team. The intervention consisted of group sessions of memory training (including computer-assisted methods), recreational and expressive activities through painting, verbal expression and writing, physiotherapy and physical training. Treatment was administered twice a week in 6-hour gatherings at a day-hospital facility. Both groups were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Instruments used: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Quality of Life in Alzheimer's disease Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). <ovid:br/>Result(s): We found a significant improvement in MCI patients in the MMSE (before: 27.6 +/- 1.7, after: 28.4 +/- 1.5; p = 0.005). No significant differences in the MMSE were found in +/-patients with AD (before: 21.2 +/- 3.8, after: 22.4 +/- 4.6; p = 0.591). The intervention brought reduction in depression symptoms as measured in the GDS for both MCI (before: 7.6 +/- 5.0, after: 6.5 +/- 4.7; p = 0.011) and AD patients (before: 4.7 +/- 3.0, after: 3.4 +/- 2.0; p < 0.001). According to the AD patients, this intervention was also beneficial their quality of life (before: 35.2 +/- 5.5, after: 36.7 +/- 4.7; p = 0.040). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The completion of the present multiprofessional rehabilitation program was associated with a significant improvement in quality of life for AD patients and a significant decrease in depressive symptoms in patients with AD and MCI. In addition, we found mild benefits on global cognitive function in patients with MCI. These results give support to the cost-effectiveness of this intervention for patients with cognitive problems. In spite of the progressive nature of AD, structured nonpharmacological interventions can yield adjunct and clinically relevant benefits in the treatment of dementia.

N2  - Background: Pharmacological treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) yields modest and time-limited benefits, rendering psychosocial interventions an important adjunct approach in the long-term management of the disease. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Patients with mild AD and their caregivers were recruited at a university-based memory clinic. Eligible patients (n=25) were assigned to a 12-week stimulation program, which was provided by a multiprofessional team. The comparison group (n=16) consisted in AD patients in the waiting list for the next available intervention schedule. The intervention consited of group sessions of memory training (including computer-assisted methods), occupational therapy, art therapy, physiotherapy and physical training. Treatment was administered twice a week in 6- hour gatherings at a day-hospital facility. Twenty-five compliant patients were compared with 16 controls. Both groups were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the intervention by raters blinded to group assignment. Instruments: Mini-Mental State Examination, Short Cognitive Test (SKT), Direct Assessment of Functional Status-Revised, Quality of Life in AD, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). <ovid:br/>Result(s): Results: Measures of global cognitive function (total SKT score) and the performance on attention tasks (SKT attention sub score) indicated that patients in the experimental group remained stable as compared to controls, who displayed mild, but significant worsening in these functions (p=0.01 and p=0.05 respectively). The intervention was also associated with reduction in depression symptoms both for patients and caregivers, according to the GDS (p=0.001 and p=0.02 respectively), and decrease in caregiver burden as a consequence of patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms (p=0.02). According to both caregivers and patients, treatment was also beneficial to the patients' quality of life (p=0.04 and p=0.004). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The completion of the present multiprofessional rehabilitation program was associated with cognitive stability and a significant improvement in quality of life in patients with AD. In addition, we found a significant decrease in depressive symptoms and caregiver burden. In spite of the progressive nature of AD, the present results support the notion that structured non-pharmacological interventions can yield adjunct and clinically relevant benefits in the treatment of dement (Table presented).

N2  - Background: In Japan, cognitive training (CT) has become popular. Adult day-care facilities where occupational / recreational therapy (ORT) are commonly performed also have become prevalent instantly after the long term care insurance started. Though many different kinds of non-pharmacological programs are running, the evidence of the effectiveness is still limited. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A volunteer sample of 114 persons whose MMSE scores were 15 or more was recruited from six adult day-care facilities in Osaka. Participants in each institute were randomized into two groups. MMSE score, age, the duration of education were matched. We addressed not only cognitive functions but also biological status such as genotype and biological markers related to dementia. One group participated in CT (simple arithmetic calculation including simulation of daily living shopping and reading Japanese elementary school textbook aloud), the other group participated inORT (painting and handicraft). The same number of therapists per participants was allocated in two interventions. They attended twice a week for 30 minutes, and continued for six months. Main outcome focused on change of cognitive function using ADAS which was assessed by blinded clinical psychotherapists. <ovid:br/>Result(s): CTand ORTwere well tolerable for the elderly at adult day-care facilities (mean age was 84, mean MMSE score was 21). As a whole, ADAS-cog score in CT group improved significantly compared to baseline, and compared toORT group. In subgroup analyses, participants without stroke history and cognitive impaired participants responded to CT, participants with stroke history responded to ORT. APOE 4 had no significant effect to interventions. Participants with KIBRA SNP (rs17070145) C allele (low episodic memory) responded to ORT. Fun and satisfaction during the programs didn't affect ADAS-cog change. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results suggested that cognitive training maintained and improved cognitive abilities especially for participants without stroke history and cognitive impaired participants at adult day-care facilities. Occupational / recreational therapy was effective for participants with stroke history or with KIBRA SNP (rs17070145) C allele.

N2  - Background: At the Day Care Centre of the Athens Association of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders, people with dementia and their families can attend a wide range of non pharmachological therapies (cognitive training, cognitive stimulation, reminiscence therapy, reality orientation therapy, physical exercise, stress management programme, psychoeducation programme etc). The present study evaluates the results of an intervention program for people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) including cognitive and physical training and compares them with a random control group of people with MCI. <ovid:br/>Method(s): 24 MCI patients aged 70 (+/- 7) years participated in a three-hour program delivered twice a week for 8 months and were compared with a control group of 20 MCI patients aged 67 years (+/- 8). Demographics were recorded for both groups. Patients' cognitive performance was measured before and after the intervention (Mini Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Clock Drawing Test, Verbal Fluency, BNT-15, Simplified Rey Figure). The statistical package for the social science (SPSS, version 13) was used to analyse data collected. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The intervention group showed improvement at the end of the eight-month period in most of the psychometric test. MoCA (F = 6.82, p = .017 and Verbal Fluency (F = 24.66, p = .001) significantly differed between the intervention and control group according to the analysis of covariance that was conducted. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): According to literature, people with MCI in this study seem to benefit from the multi-component rehabilitation programme in comparison to control group. Cognitive training and physical exercise seem to be the non pharmachological therapy of choice for people with MCI. (Graph presented).

N2  - Background: Cognitive decline occurs in 16-35.5% of older hospitalised patients. Specific in-hospital interventions such as cognitively stimulating activities might combat cognitive decline. However, evidence supporting such interventions is limited. We reported a pilot study conducted to determine the effects of cognitively stimulating activities in older patients undergoing elective hip and/or knee replacement. <ovid:br/>Method(s): For this randomised controlled pilot trial, 50 older patients (90% women with a mean age of 72.8 years) were recruited from three orthopaedic wards at a tertiary medical centre in Taiwan. While hospitalised, participants in the intervention group received a daily nurse-led cognitive-stimulation intervention. The comparison group received usual care. All participants' cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination scores at admission, discharge, and 1 month after discharge. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The incidence of cognitive decline by hospital discharge, defined as >2-point decline in cognitive function score, was significantly lower (P < 0.05) for the intervention group (12%) than the usual care group (44%). The intervention group also had better cognitive function scores following hospitalisation. Upon discharge, participants in the intervention group scored 1.28 cognitive function points higher than at admission while scores of participants in the usual care declined 0.76 points (P < 0.05). Improvement in cognitive status persisted for the intervention group (+1.33 points) versus usual care (-0.26 points) (P < 0.05) at 1 month after discharge. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This nurse-led, daily 20- to 30-minute cognitive-stimulation intervention benefited global cognitive function among older patients undergoing elective hip and/or knee replacement. The benefit persisted at 1 month after discharge.

N2  - The effect of cognitive intervention on brain metabolism in AD is largely unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to investigate cognitive parameters and <ovid:sup>18</ovid:sup>FDG PET to test for effects of a cognitive intervention in patients with aMCI or mild AD. Patients with aMCI (N = 24) or mild AD (N = 15) were randomly assigned either to cognitive intervention groups (IGs), receiving weekly sessions of group-based multicomponent cognitive intervention, or active control groups (CGs), receiving pencil-paper exercises for self-study. We obtained resting-state FDG-PET scans and neuropsychological testing at baseline and after six-months. Normalized FDG-PET images were analyzed using voxel-based SPM5 approaches to determine longitudinal changes, group-by-time interactions and correlations with neuropsychological outcome parameters. Primary global cognitive outcome was determined by analyses of covariance with MMSE and ADAS-cog scores as dependent measures. Both, aMCI and AD subgroups of CGs showed widespread bilateral cortical declines in FDG uptake, while the AD subgroup of IGs showed discrete decline or rather no decline in case of the aMCI subgroup. Group by time analyses revealed strongest attenuation of metabolic decline in the aMCI subgroup of the IGs, involving left anterior temporal pole and anterior cingulate gyrus. However, correlation analyses revealed only weak non-significant associations between increased FDG uptake and improvement in primary or secondary outcome parameters. Concurrently, there was significant improvement in global cognitive status in the aMCI subgroup of the IGs. A six-month cognitive intervention imparted cognitive benefits in patients with aMCI, which were concurrent with an attenuated decline of glucose metabolism in cortical regions affected by neurodegenerative AD. &#xa9; 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

N2  - The present study compared men and women who suffered a frontal lobe stroke with regard to problem solving, decision making, impulsive behavior and depressive symptoms and also correlated these variables between groups. The sample was composed of 10 males and nine females. The study period was 6 months after the stroke. The following instruments were used: Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST), Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), Barrat Impulsiveness Scale (BIS11), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). For the exclusion criteria of the sample, the Mini International Psychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I Plus) and Mini Mental Stage Examination (MMSE) were used. To measure functional severity post-stroke, the Rankin Scale was used. The average age was 60.90 +/- 8.93 years for males and 60.44 +/- 11.57 years for females. In females, total impulsiveness (p =.013) and lack of planning caused by impulsiveness (p =.028) were significantly higher compared with males, assessed by the BIS11. These data indicate that females in the present sample who suffered a chronic frontal lesion were more impulsive and presented more planning difficulties in situations without demanding cognitive processing. These results that show gender differences should be considered when planning psychotherapy and cognitive rehabilitation for patients who present these characteristics.

N2  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients are at increased risk of developing dementia. There is a conflict if cognitive interventions can improve cognitive and functional performances in order to delay the development of dementia. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a holistic cognitive rehabilitation program on patients with MCI. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The participants, 176 MCI patients with Mini-Mental State Examination = 27.89 (1.73), were classified into 2 groups matched for age, gender, education and cognitive abilities: (1) patients (104) on nonpharmacological therapy and (2) patients (72) on no therapy at all. The effectiveness of the interventions was assessed by neuropsychological evaluation performed at baseline and at the end of the interventions. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Between-group difference in benefit of the experimental group was demonstrated in abilities of executive function (p = 0.004), verbal memory (p = 0.003), praxis (p <= 0.012), daily function (p = 0.001) and general cognitive ability (p <= 0.005). The experimental patients improved cognitive and functional performances, while the control patients demonstrated deterioration in daily function (p = 0.004). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our findings indicate that nonpharmacological therapy of the holistic approach can improve MCI patients' cognitive and functional performances.

T1  - Memory Training and Strategy Use in Older Adults: Results From the ACTIVE Study
A1  - Gross A.L.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Little is known about the long-term effects of memory training in later life on strategy use. Data from the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study (n = 1,401) were used to describe strategy use in a community-dwelling sample of older adults. Strategy clustering scores on verbal list learning tasks of episodic memory were used to test the impact of memory training on strategy use and study longitudinal associations between strategy clustering, memory performance, and everyday functioning. Results suggested that younger, female, white, healthier, and more educated participants show higher strategy clustering scores initially but no characteristics were consistently associated with different trajectories in strategy clustering across all strategy clustering measures together. Memory training had significant immediate effects on all measures of strategy use that were maintained through five years of follow-up. With respect to longitudinal mediation, pre-post training changes in most strategy clustering scores mediate changes in objective memory performance and everyday functioning, implying that strategies can be modified and are closely related to both memory ability and the ability to function independently. This study provides evidence that older adults can be trained to use cognitive strategies, the effects are durable, and strategies are associated with memory and everyday functioning. &#xa9; 2011 American Psychological Association.

N2  - Background. Health care expenditures for older adults are disproportionately high and increasing at both the individual and population levels. We evaluated the effects of the three cognitive training interventions (memory, reasoning, or speed of processing) in the ACTIVE study on changes in predicted medical care expenditures. Methods. ACTIVE was a multisite randomized controlled trial of older adults ( 65). Five-year follow-up data were available for 1,804 of the 2,802 participants. Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for potential attrition bias. Changes in predicted annualmedical expenditures were calculated at the first and fifth annual follow-up assessments using a new method for translating functional status scores. Multiple linear regression methods were used in this cost-offset analysis. Results. At one and five years post-training, annual predicted expenditures declinedby $223 (p =.024) and $128 (p =.309), respectively, in the speed of processing treatment group, but there were no statistically significant changes in the memory or reasoning treatment groups compared to the no-contact control group at either period. Statistical adjustment for age, race, education, MMSE scores, ADL and IADL performance scores, EPT scores, chronic condition counts, and the SF-36 PCS and MCS scores at baseline did not alter the one-year ($244; p =.012) or five-year ($143; p =.250) expenditure declines in the speed of processing treatment group. Conclusion. The speed of processing intervention significantly reduced subsequent annual predicted medical care expenditures at the one-year post-baseline comparison, but annual savings were no longer statistically significant at the five-year post-baseline comparison. &#xa9; 2009 Wolinsky et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: In general, recent cognitive training has received increasing interest as a solution to age-related cognitive decline. Although the general public's interest in cognitive or brain training is increasing, the generalizing or transfer effect of such training remains unclear. We previously introduced a new cognitive intervention program for senile dementia, named learning therapy. The principle of learning therapy is to activate the prefrontal cortex by solving simple mathematical and language problems. The purpose of this study was to examine the beneficial effects of a new cognitive intervention program designed for normal aged people, the concepts of which are is derived from learning therapy. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We applied a similar daily cognitive training program to community-dwelling seniors to determine the effects of training on cognitive functions, particularly on the function of the prefrontal cortex, by a single-blind randomized controlled trial and a large scale cohort study. In these studies, neuropsychological measures were determined prior to and after six months of the intervention (post-test) by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), frontal assessment battery at bed side (FAB), and a digit-symbol substitution test (DST) of WAIS-R. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The results indicate that the transfer effect of cognitive intervention by reading and solving arithmetic problems on non-targeted cognitive functions was demonstrated in both studies, and are convincing evidence that cognitive training has the beneficial effects of maintaining and improving cognitive functions. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The psychological stimulations made possible by expertise and technology in brain science can improve the higher cognitive functions of seniors.

T1  - Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST): Effects on different areas of cognitive function for people with dementia
A1  - Spector A.

A1  - Woods B.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: There is good evidence indicating that group Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) leads to generalised cognitive benefits for people with dementia. However, little is known about whether some aspects of cognition might change more than others and why. Methods Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, a 14-session group treatment, has been evaluated in a multi-centre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial. This study looks at the subscales of the ADAS-Cog (memory and new learning, praxis and language) and compares the outcome of CST with a treatment as usual control group. Results There was a significant difference between treatment and control groups in total ADAS-Cog score (p = 0.01) and in the language subscale (p = 0.01). There were no significant changes in memory and orientation or praxis. Conclusions CST appears to have particular effects in promoting language function, which is likely to lead to generalised benefits. This may be through generating opinions and creating new semantic links through categorisation. Future research might use more sensitive psychometric tests to assess these effects in more depth.

N2  - Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchEIs) are extensively used in Alzheimer's disease (AD) while reality orientation therapy (ROT) is a cognitive rehabilitation indicated for mentally deteriorated patients. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of donepezil with an intensive ROT with active participation of the caregiver. Patients with AD (n= 100, mean age 78.4 +/- 4.3 years) initiated treatment with donepezil, 5. mg/day; 62 of them underwent a 3-week, daily ROT and physical reactivation training with the caregiver (Group A); 38 participants received only donepezil therapy (Group B). All subjects were tested for cognitive and functional abilities at baseline, at the end of the training program, and after 2 months of follow-up. There was a significant improvement in mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score (p<. 0.001) and the AD assessment scale-cognitive (ADAS-Cog) subscale (p<. 0.001), without changes in impaired activity of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) after intensive ROT training in Group A. MMSE was maintained after 2 months in-home ROT continuation. There were no significant changes in MMSE in drug-only treated patients (Group B) after 3 weeks, with a non-significant tendency to improvement in ADAS-Cog. Our results suggest benefit of an intensive ROT program in dementia patients receiving donepezil that seems to be maintained as far as ROT is continued by the caregiver. &#xa9; 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background. This study investigated the performance of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia for incidental recognition memory and the effect of encoding strategies on contextual memory. Methods. The authors studied 21 patients with PD (ages 60-85, 12 women; Hoehn and Yahr I-III, Activities of Daily Living 70%-100%) and 22 healthy controls (ages 60-84, 18 women). Participants completed the vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). To assess the incidental recognition memory for item (object) and context (location of the object), participants of each group were assigned to 1 of 2 encoding conditions: ( a) an incidental associative instruction to bind the object to its location or (b) a nonassociative, nonspecific instruction. Results. PD patients showed performance comparable to the control group's on the vocabulary subtest and WCST. In contrast to controls, PD patients were unable to take advantage of the associative encoding instruction, which also had a deleterious effect on item recognition. Conclusion. This sample of participants with PD showed diminished item and context recognition memory and an impaired ability to use incidental memory encoding strategy, suggesting a compromised cognitive reserve. The fact that these alterations occurred in early stages of PD, and prior to more general cognitive alterations such as executive dysfunction, should be considered in the management of patients by using specific cognitive rehabilitation interventions. &#xa9; 2010 The Author(s).

N2  - Objectives: To provide evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation (CR) in early-stage Alzheimer disease (AD). <ovid:br/>Design(s): Single-blind randomized controlled trial comparing CR with relaxation therapy and no treatment. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): Outpatient, community-based setting. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Sixty-nine individuals (41 women, 28 men; mean age 77.78 years, standard deviation 6.32, range = 56-89) with a diagnosis of AD or mixed AD and vascular dementia and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 18 or above, and receiving a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting medication. Forty-four family carers also contributed. INTERVENTION:: Eight weekly individual sessions of CR consisting of personalized interventions to address individually relevant goals supported by components addressing practical aids and strategies, techniques for learning new information, practice in maintaining attention and concentration, and techniques for stress management. Measurements: The primary outcomes were goal performance and satisfaction, assessed using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Questionnaires assessing mood, quality of life and carer strain, and a brief neuropsychological test battery were also administered. A subset of participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). <ovid:br/>Result(s): CR produced significant improvement in ratings of goal performance and satisfaction, whereas scores in the other two groups did not change. Behavioral changes in the CR group were supported by fMRI data for a subset of participants. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The findings support the clinical efficacy of CR in early-stage AD. CR offers a means of assisting people with early-stage AD and their families in managing the effects of the condition. &#xa9; 2010 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

N2  - Background: We evaluated the effects of cognitive training on self-rated health at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years post-baseline. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In the ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly) randomized controlled trial, 2,802 older adults (65 years) were randomly assigned to memory, reasoning, speed of processing, or no-contact control intervention groups. Complete data were available for 1,804 (64%) of the 2,802 participants at five years. A propensity score model was adjusted for attrition bias. The self-rated health question was coded using the Diehr et al. (2001) transformation (E = 95/VG = 90/G = 80/F = 30/P = 15), and analyzed with change-score regression models. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The speed of processing (vs. no-contact control) group had statistically significant improvements (or protective effects) on changes in self-rated health at the 2, 3 and 5 year follow-ups. The 5-year improvement was 2.8 points (p = 0.03). No significant differences were observed in the memory or reasoning groups at any time. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The speed of processing intervention significantly protected self-rated health in ACTIVE, with the average benefit equivalent to half the difference between excellent vs. very good health. &#xa9; 2009 International Psychogeriatric Association.

N2  - Background: For the study of dementia, it is significant to cognitive treatment or cognitive training. Kaeasdhima (2006) demonstrates that utilizing simple materials, reading and arithmetic exercises could activate the function of prefrontal lobe. However, there are cultural differences in practical applications of these approaches. In this study, the authors adopted similar ap-proaches according to our cultural background, trying to observe the effectiveness of group cognitive treatment with local social/cultural ele-ments. Moreover, the form of cognitive treatment is group process instead of individual treatment, of which well-being is measured. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Subjects with mildly to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease participated the study. In experiment group, 12 subjects aged between 65 and 85 were enrolled, and 75% of them were illiterate. They received weekly group cognitive treatment for one year. Each session lasted for fifty minutes with utilization of simple materials, reading simple texts and arithmetic exercises matched with Chi-nese culture. Another 8 subjects at similar stages were selected as control group. All of patients are assessed with MMSE at baseline, middle and the end of the study. Furthermore, in the measurement of well-being, experiment subjects compare with others- 10 OPD, 8 home care, and 9 nursing home of patients. All they are assessed with Philadelphia Geriatric Center (PGC) Morale Scale (Lawton, 1975), including agitation, attitude toward own aging, lonely dissatisfaction. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Average MMSE scores in the experiment group are higher than control group. The result shows that group of the cognitive treatment is effective in the patient with mild to moderate stages of AD. In addition, PGC morale Scale scores in experiment group, no matter in the scale of agitation, attitude toward own aging, lonely dissatisfaction, are also higher than others. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The study verifies that group cognitive treatment is effective and applicable to the patient with mild to moderate AD. Otherwise, the group has more well-being than other kinds of patients after group cognitive treatment. It is accordance with the study of Kaeasd-hima (2006) by utilizing simple materials could improve cognitive function. In conclusion, group cognitive treatment may have not only protective effect on cognitive functions but more well-being in the patients with mild to mod-erate AD.

N2  - Background: Non-pharmacological therapies for elderly to maintain and improve cognitive abilities have limited evidences, especially for dementia like Alzheimer type have poor evidences. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A volunteer sample of more than 100 persons whose MMSE scores were 15 or more was recruited from six adult day-care facilities in Osaka. Participants in each institute were randomized into two groups. MMSE score, age, the duration of education were matched. We addressed not only cognitive functions but also biological status such as genotype and biological markers related to dementia. One group participated in cognitive training (simple arithmetic calculation including simulation of daily living shopping and reading Japanese elementary school textbook aloud), the other group participated in creative activities (painting and handicraft). The same number of therapists per participants was allocated in two interventions. They attended twice a week for 30 minutes, and continued for six months. Main outcome focused on change of cognitive function using ADAS which was assessed by blinded clinical psychotherapists. MMSE and FAB were assessed by them, too. MOSES, FIM were assessed by day-care staffs. In the next six months, two groups switched their interventions (crossover trial). (Please see the presentation entitled "Cognitive Training on Elderly Japanese in Osaka: Major Outcome (ADAS) from Prospective, Randomized, Open, Blinded-Endpoint Trial") Results: We made subgroup analyses between two interventions about changes of ADAS scores. In the first six months, ADAS scores were more improved by cognitive training than creative activity in these subgroups: from 75 to 89 years old (P = 0.047), no history of stroke (P = 0.011), 10 or more in ADAS scores (P = 0.032), 20 or more in ADAS scores (P = 0.011), 23 or less in MMSE scores (P = 0.039) and APOEe4 Carrier (P = 0.090). Combining the first and second six months data, similar results were observed in these subgroup anal-yses (P = 0.004,0.002,0.026,0.008,0.008,0.021). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results suggested that cognitive training maintained and improved cognitive abilities for day services users who had AD related factor(s). We have plan to diagnosis Alzheimer type dementia, and present further analyses at the conference.

N2  - Background: In Japan, cognitive training become popular. Adult day-care facilities where occupational therapy and/or recreation activities are commonly performed also have become prevalent instantly after the long term care insurance started. Though many different kinds of non-pharmacological programs are running (creative activities etc.), the evidence of the effectiveness is still limited. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A volunteer sample of more than 100 persons whose MMSE scores were 15 or more was recruited from six adult day-care facilities in Osaka. Participants in each institute were randomized into two groups. MMSE score, age, the duration of education were matched. We addressed not only cognitive functions but also biological status such as genotype and biolog-ical markers related to dementia. One group participated in cognitive training (simple arithmetic calculation including simulation of daily living shopping and reading Japanese elementary school textbook aloud), the other group partic-ipated in creative activities (painting and handicraft). The same number of ther-apists per participants was allocated in two interventions. They attended twice a week for 30 minutes, and continued for six months. Main outcome focused on change of cognitive function using ADAS which was assessed by blinded clinical psychotherapists. MMSE and FAB (Frontal Assessment Battery at bed-side) were assessed by them, too. MOSES (the multidimensional observation scale for elderly subjects), FIM (Functional Independence Measure) were as-sessed by day-care staffs. In the next six months, two groups switched their in-terventions (crossover trial). <ovid:br/>Result(s): The ADAS scores were improved significantly by cognitive training (the first six months: from 17.5 to 15.1, P=0.002, the second six months: from 14.9 to 13.3, P=0.03), but were not significantly by creative activities (the first six months: from 17.1 to 16.1, P=0.11, the second six months: from 15.2 to 15.7, P=0.56). Changes of ADAS scores were different significantly between two interventions (P=0.04). Changes of ADAS scores between two groups were not different significantly, which sug-gested differences of carryover effects were not significant between two interventions. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our results suggested that cognitive training maintained and improved elderly cognitive abilities.

N2  - Introduction. The evidence for the clinical effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is debated. Therefore it is important to collect more evidence about the outcome of non-pharmacological therapy of dementia. Material and Methods. We report data concerning the rehabilitation of 50 patients with probable AD admitted during a 17-month period in a specialized unit. Participants were affected by dementia ranging from mild to severe. The patients were treated with the Reality Orientation Therapy (ROT), integrated, when needed, with individualised cognitive approaches. The results concern: the cognitive status, evaluated by means of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the functional status, evaluated with the Activity of Daily Living (ADL) scale, the assessment of psychological and behavioural disorders measured with the Neuropsychiatry Inventory (NPI). The cognitive, functional, and psychopathological assessments were administered at admission and discharge. Results. The mean MMSE scores at admission and discharge were respectively 16.06 and 17.54 (Wilcoxon Ranks Test: p=0.005). Mean ADL scores were 4.86 at admission and 5.02 at discharge (p=0.011). Mean NPI scores were respectively 21.46 and 12.26 (p<0.001). Conclusions. This survey of the 17-month experience suggests that a comprehensive treatment program may have beneficial effects on cognitive, functional, and in particular neuropsychiatric outcomes. The results should be verified with a randomised clinical trial. &#xa9; 2007 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives: to study the efficacy of combined treatment (anticholinesterase drugs and cognitive stimulation) in improving cognitive function in patients with moderate dementia after a 2-year follow-up. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): fifty patients (64.0% women, mean age 77.9 years [SD 6.2]) diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in functional assessment stage (FAST) >= 4 were included. The patients were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups: group 1 (n = 12) received cognitive stimulation; group 2 (n = 13) received drug therapy; group 3 (n = 12) received combined therapy (drug therapy plus cognitive stimulation), and group 4 (n = 13) received no treatment. The evaluator was blind to treatment allocation. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated after 1 and 2 years through the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) and FAST. The results obtained in the distinct study groups were compared after follow-up (repeated measures ANOVA). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. <ovid:br/>Result(s): at the end of 1 year, the two treatment groups showed significant positive changes compared with cognitive decline in the control group in all the scales studied (p < 0.0001). After 2 years, deterioration was homogeneous in these groups, although group 3 (combined therapy) showed a nonsignificant tendency toward slowing of functional deterioration compared with the remaining groups. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): combined treatment (pharmacological and cognitive) in moderate-stage AD produces beneficial effects during the first year of treatment and mitigates the deterioration produced in the second year in comparison with other forms of treatment.

N2  - Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated by chronic hypoxemia, but the effect of cognitive training in patients with COPD has not been studied. The aim of the present study was to verify whether cognitive training can preserve cognitive abilities of patients with hypoxemic COPD. Our series consisted of 105 COPD patients with at rest (n = 36) or effort (n = 69) hypoxemia and free from concurrent dementing diseases. Neuropsychologic assessment included a screening test, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and a standardized confirmatory battery of neuropsychological tests, the Mental Deterioration Battery (MDB). After baseline assessment, patients were randomized to receive standardized multidimensional care (standardization of pharmacological therapy, health education, selection of inhalers according to patient's ability, respiratory rehabilitation, nutritional counseling, oxygen therapy, and control visits) with (n = 53) or without (n = 52) cognitive training aimed at stimulating attention, learning, and logical-deductive thinking. Cognitive performance was reassessed after 1.5, 4, and 6 months. The analysis of variance for repeated measures (ANOVA) having the group membership (study vs. control) as grouping factor was used to assess changes in cognitive performance. Both intervention and control groups showed no significant changes in cognitive performance except for a trend toward improvement in verbal fluency and verbal memory, but cognitive intervention had no significant effect. In conclusion, cognitive training seems ineffective in COPD. However, a multidimensional standardized therapeutic approach, as it was indistinctly provided to all patients, could help to slow or prevent cognitive decline. &#xa9; 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

T1  - The influence of cognitive rehabilitation on cognitive competence in patients with Alzheimer's disease
A1  - Oresnik M.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The development of dementia in Alzheimer's disease is known to be influenced by various factors. The research was carried out on 16 patients with a probable diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), who were first evaluated with MMSE. The patients were then divided according to gender, age, and the progress of the illness into two equal groups. The first group of patients was assigned an additional cognitive therapy for improving cognitive abilities alongside regular treatment while the second group was assigned only regular treatment. After 6 months the patients were re-evaluated using MMSE. The results show a statistically significant difference in cognitive abilities between the two groups with regard to the pre-therapy results. The results of the research are consistent with the results of other researches which imply a slower decrease in cognitive abilities in AD patients who are mentally active. &#xa9; Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia.

N2  - We examined the relationships between alcohol use, cognitive and affective variables, and the potential differential benefits of training for older adults drinkers and non-drinkers who participated in a randomized trial implemented between 2001-2006. Participants, who were living independently in the community, were randomly assigned to either twelve hours of memory training or health promotion classes. Outcomes included depression, health, cognition, verbal, visual, memory, and performance-based IADLs. The sample was 79% female, 17% Hispanic and 12% African-American. The typical participant had an average age of 75 years with 13 years of education. In the memory intervention group, there were 135 individuals (63 drinkers, 72 non-drinkers). In the health promotion condition, there were 129 individuals (58 drinkers and 71 non-drinkers). At baseline, drinkers scored higher on cognition, verbal memory, and lower on depression than non-drinkers. Alcohol use was positively related to physical health at baseline as measured by the Physical Component Summary Score of the Medical Outcomes Health Scale (SF-36). We found significant effects for the time*drinking*treatment group interaction in the repeated measures ANCOVA for the Mini Mental Status Examination, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, and the SF-36 Mental Health sub-scale. The time*drinking*group interactions were not statistically significant for any of the other outcomes. This study demonstrated that older adults benefited from targeted psychosocial interventions on affective, cognitive and functional outcomes. In addition, the SeniorWISE study provides empirical support to the research evidence emphasizing the health benefits of moderate alcohol consumption in older adults.

N2  - The aim of the present study is to evaluate the outcomes of a computer-based cognitive training on patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared with the outcomes on patients affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI), multiple system atrophy (MSA). Ten AD patients aged 74.1 +/- 5.6 years, with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score at baseline of 23.9 +/- 2.4, and 10 MCI patients aged 70.6 +/- 6.0 years, with MMSE score of 28.0 +/- 1.4, attending our day-hospital of neurorehabilitation were selected for the study. Three MSA patients aged 69.0 +/- 9.5 years, MMSE scores 26.7 +/- 2.3 were selected from the same setting in order to have a different control group. Each patient attended two training programs and was evaluated according to cognitive and non-cognitive functions at baseline at the end of the second training program. The AD group showed a significant MMSE score improvement (p = 0.010). On the contrary, MMSE scores at baseline and at follow-up remained quite stable in the other two groups. AD patients also showed significant improvement in the areas of verbal production (p = 0.036) and executive functions (p = 0.050). MCI patients significantly improved in behavioral memory (p = 0.017; p = 0.011). No significant improvement was observed in MSA group. Our data seem to indicate that the same individualized rehabilitative intervention could have different effects according to patient's diagnosis. MCI and AD patients had significant improvements in global cognitive status and/or in specific cognitive areas. On the contrary, MSA patients did not benefit at all. &#xa9; 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Several studies have shown that pharmacological and cognitive treatments for Alzheimers's disease improve cognitive function for short periods, but fewer studies have evaluated the efficacy of those treatments for longer (2-year) periods. An initial sample of 68 subjects with mild Alzheimer's disease underwent clinical and cognitive evaluation. After evaluation, subjects were assigned to four different groups and participated in a 2-year follow-up study. Group 1 (n = 14) received combined drug and cognitive stimulation, group 2 (n = 20) received only drug treatment, group 3 (n = 14) received only cognitive stimulation, and group 4 (n = 30) received no treatment at all. Results confirmed previous investigation, cognitive and combined stimulation improved patients' performance throughout the 1st year; however, all groups deteriorated gradually throughout the 2nd year of treatment. According to this evidence, it can be concluded that we cannot stop cognitive deterioration after 2 years of treatment, although deterioration is greater and its progress faster in patients not receiving any treatment at all.

N2  - Objective: To determine the usefulness of an interactive multimedia internet-based system (IMIS) for the cognitive stimulation of Alzheimer's disease. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This is a 24-week, single-blind, randomised pilot study conducted on 46 mildly impaired patients suspected of having Alzheimer's disease receiving stable treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs). The patients were divided into three groups: (1) those who received 3 weekly, 20-min sessions of IMIS in addition to 8 h/day of an integrated psychostimulation program (IPP); (2) those who received only IPP sessions; and (3) those who received only ChEI treatment. The primary outcome measure was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog). Secondary outcome measures were: MiniMental State Examination (MMSE), Syndrom Kurztest, Boston Naming Test, Verbal Fluency, and the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test story recall subtest. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After 12 weeks, the patients treated with both IMIS and IPP had improved outcome scores on the ADAS-Cog and MMSE, which was maintained through 24 weeks of follow-up. The patients treated with IPP alone had better outcome than those treated with ChEIs alone, but the effects were attenuated after 24 weeks. All patients had improved scores in all of the IMIS individual tasks, attaining higher levels of difficulty in all cases. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Although both the IPP and IMIS improved cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease, the IMIS program provided an improvement above and beyond that seen with IPP alone, which lasted for 24 weeks.

T1  - A newly revised cognitive function test for dementia as compared to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
A1  - Fukushima K.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Background: It is important to examine the cognitive functions in dementia patients for further diagnostic evaluation and rehabilitation. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): 164 patients with complaints of memory disturbances visited and/or were admitted to our clinic from October 2003 to August 2005. Among them, 84 patients had suffered stroke episodes. The results of the newly revised cognitive function test were compared to those of the MMSE. Also, 5 of the patients were trained using the same cognitive function tasks. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The "delayed recall of 3 words" in the MMSE and the "4 words memory task" in the cognitive function test were frequently disturbing for those in the early stage of dementia. The "naming of a prefecture and 2 items" in the MMSE, as well as visual gnosis, auditory gnosis, and long-term memory function in the cognitive function test were unaffected in those in the advanced stage of dementia. The results of both the MMSE and the cognitive function test showed no significant differences between patients who had suffered a stroke and those who had not. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The cognitive function test used in the diagnosis and rehabilitation of dementia patients is as useful as the MMSE.

N2  - Background. Recent findings of neuroimaging studies indicate that reading aloud and arithmetic calculation activate bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of humans. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of reading aloud and arithmetic calculation, by elderly people who were clinically diagnosed with dementia Alzheimer type, on their brain functions and activities of daily living. Methods. Sixteen experimental and 16 age- and Mini-Mental State Examination score-matched control subjects participated. The participants in the experimental group were asked to perform a training program using learning tasks in reading and arithmetic for 2-6 days a week. The function of the frontal cortex of the subjects was assessed by FAB at bedside (Frontal Assessment Battery). Results. After 6 months of training, the FAB score of the experimental group showed a statistically significant improvement. The FAB score of the control group decreased slightly over the 6-month period, and the difference between the scores of the experimental and control groups was statistically significant. We also observed the restoration of communication and independence in the experimental group. Conclusion. Our results indicate that learning tasks of reading aloud and arithmetic calculation can be used for cognitive rehabilitation of dementia patients.

N2  - A study was performed on patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in order to evaluate the efficacy of a combined treatment (donepezil plus cognitive training) in both cognitive processes and affective states. Eighty-six subjects, 25 men and 61 women, with an average age of 75.58 years, were studied. Almost all the subjects had a basic educational level. Donezepil was administered at a dose of 10 mg daily along with cognitive treatment involving images of everyday life and reminiscent music; the sessions took place on Monday to Friday and lasted three quarters of an hour. The study lasted 12 months. Subjects underwent test-retest with the following tests: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog); the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the overall deterioration scale (FAST). The results showed that subjects receiving the combined treatment had a better response than those who did not receive any cognitive training. These subjects' MMSE score decreased by 3.24 on average. The affective symptomatology of those receiving only drug treatment improved whereas the cognitive processes did not. Copyright &#xa9; 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Background: A recent Cochrane review of reality orientation therapy identified the need for large, well-designed, multi-centretrials. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): To test the hypothesis that cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) for older people with dementiawould benefit cognition and quality of life. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A single-blind, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial recruited 201 older people with dementia. The main outcome measures were change in cognitive function and quality of life. An intention-to-treat analysis used analysis of covariance to control for potential variability in baseline measures. <ovid:br/>Result(s): One hundred and fifteen people were randomised within centres to the intervention group and 86 to the control group. At follow-up the intervention group had significantly improved relative to the control group on the Mini-Mental State Examination (P=0.044), the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition (ADAS-Cog) (P=0.014) and Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease scales (P=0.028). Using criteria of 4 points or more improvement on the ADAS-Cog the number needed to treat was 6 for the intervention group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results compare favourably with trials of drugs for dementia. CST groups may have worthwhile benefits for many people with dementia.

N2  - Preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation interventions based on errorless learning principles in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) was provided by Clare et al. (1999, 2000, 2001). The present study extends these findings in a controlled trial. Twelve participants meeting criteria for probable AD, with Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 18 or above, were trained in face-name associations using an errorless learning paradigm. Training produced a significant group improvement in recall of trained, but not control, items. Gains were largely maintained 6 months later, in the absence of practice. There were differences in individual response to intervention. Results did not differ according to medication status, and the intervention had no adverse effects on self-reported well-being, but participants who were more aware of their memory difficulties achieved better outcomes.
